# Managed Provider Completion Reliability Plan

## 1. Document Role

This document defines the architecture plan for reliable completion detection and terminalization for managed pane-backed providers.

Primary trigger incidents:

- GitHub issue `#180`
  - managed Codex on macOS accepts work but never converges the job out of `running`
- GitHub issue `#181`
  - managed Gemini on macOS leaves jobs in `running` when `AfterAgent` misfires, fires on the wrong turn, or never fires after provider-side failure / long-thinking state

This document is intentionally broader than "mac bugfix notes".

The current incidents were surfaced on macOS, but the design defect is not mac-only:

- provider completion authority is too dependent on one fragile provider-specific signal
- runtime artifact contracts are not validated as a coherent system
- `ccbd` has no generic completion-timeout closure when a provider never emits its expected terminal artifact

This plan applies to:

- managed `codex`
- managed `claude`
- managed `gemini`

in pane-backed mode only.

This document does not replace:

- `docs/ccbd-startup-supervision-contract.md`
- `docs/ccbd-diagnostics-contract.md`
- `docs/codex-session-isolation-contract.md`
- `docs/claude-session-isolation-contract.md`
- `docs/gemini-session-isolation-contract.md`
- `docs/opencode-completion-contract.md`

`opencode` already has its own completion contract and should not be silently folded into the changes below.

## 2. Current Problem

### 2.1 Surface Symptoms

Issue `#180` shows:

- Codex pane finishes visible work
- job remains `running`
- `ccb kill -f` is the only way to clear the execution
- runtime file layout is inconsistent:
  - session payload advertises `bridge_output.log`
  - bridge runtime writes `bridge.log`
  - `completion/` is not guaranteed to exist

Issue `#181` shows:

- Gemini hook is registered correctly
- hook artifact may be written for the wrong request id
- hook may emit `completed` with empty reply for an auth / info banner turn
- hook may never emit for the actual request after provider-side API failure or long-thinking stall
- job remains `running` forever because no alternate closure path exists

### 2.2 Shared Structural Root Cause

The shared problem is not "mac has weird timing".

The shared problem is:

```text
provider completion authority
  = split across provider-specific artifact assumptions
  + no unified runtime bootstrap validation
  + no generic no-terminal-evidence timeout
  + weak request-turn attribution for hook-driven providers
```

Current behavior by family:

- Codex
  - modeled as `PROTOCOL_TURN`
  - depends on Codex log/session reading
  - runtime layout contract is duplicated across launcher/session payload/bridge code
- Claude
  - modeled as `SESSION_BOUNDARY`
  - may use observed session events plus hook shortcut
- Gemini
  - modeled as `ANCHORED_SESSION_STABILITY`
  - currently treats hook artifact as the decisive exact terminal source when present

All three families currently lack a single reliability boundary that answers:

- what runtime artifacts must exist before the provider is considered launch-ready
- what the primary completion source is
- what alternative evidence may be used when the primary source is absent or misattributed
- how long a job may remain `running` without new reliable completion evidence
- how `ccbd` should converge the job when the provider stays alive but never emits a valid terminal signal

## 3. Architectural Diagnosis

### 3.1 Missing Completion Reliability Plane

Today the stack is:

- provider adapter emits items / terminal decision
- execution service persists whatever the provider emits
- dispatcher terminalizes the job only when the provider emitted a terminal decision

This means:

- if a provider returns `None` forever, the job remains `running` forever
- `ccbd` has no cross-provider closure authority for "provider alive but completion evidence missing"

That is the central design defect.

### 3.2 Missing Runtime Artifact Contract

Managed pane-backed providers also lack a strict runtime bootstrap contract.

Example from Codex:

- launcher payload says `tmux_log = runtime_dir/bridge_output.log`
- bridge env exports `CODEX_TMUX_LOG = runtime_dir/bridge_output.log`
- bridge runtime writes to `runtime_dir/bridge.log`

This is a direct contract split.

As long as file paths are duplicated across:

- launcher
- bridge runtime
- session payload
- readers

the system will continue to accumulate platform-sensitive residue bugs.

### 3.3 Weak Turn Attribution For Hook Providers

Current Gemini / Claude hook handling is too weakly bound to the active request turn.

Current artifact model:

- one file per `req_id`
- hook script extracts request id from prompt or transcript
- `load_event()` reads a single terminal event file

Problems:

- a hook may fire for an auth / info / retry side turn
- extracted `req_id` may refer to the last visible request marker, not the currently intended answer turn
- empty reply must not be terminalized as `completed`; hook-driven providers
  should report `incomplete` with diagnostics when a completion hook fires
  without assistant-visible reply text

Claude `Stop` hooks must not infer request identity by scanning for the latest
visible `CCB_REQ_ID` or latest `last-prompt`. The hook must bind the current
assistant stop to its actual transcript turn, walk the `parentUuid` chain back
to the turn's prompt user message, skip tool-result user records, and only emit
a completion artifact when that prompt itself is anchored by an outer
`CCB_REQ_ID`. Scheduled-task turns, user-interruption turns, auth/info turns, or
other provider-side turns must not reuse an earlier CCB request id.

This is not a mere parser issue.

It is a missing turn-identity contract.

### 3.4 No Generic No-Evidence Timeout

A managed request can currently get stuck in this bad state:

- pane is alive
- provider is still attached
- request was accepted and started
- partial or unrelated completion items may have been observed
- no valid terminal artifact arrives
- no provider adapter emits terminal decision
- execution stays active forever

That must not be legal.

## 4. Design Goals

The target architecture is:

```text
managed pane-backed request
  = one declared primary completion source
  + one validated runtime artifact contract
  + optional secondary degraded evidence sources
  + one control-plane-owned timeout closure path
```

Required outcomes:

- no managed job may stay `running` forever only because the provider never emitted a valid terminal artifact
- runtime artifact path mismatches must fail fast during startup, not surface later as zombie jobs
- hook-driven providers must not burn a job id on an unrelated auth/info turn
- diagnostics must show which completion source was expected, which one was observed, and why the job terminalized
- the design must preserve provider-family differences without scattering reliability logic across random call sites

## 5. Non-Goals

This plan does not:

- change keeper / `ccbd` lifecycle authority
- redefine `.ccb` startup authority
- replace provider-family-specific readers with one universal parser
- add native Windows support
- change `opencode` completion semantics

## 6. New Boundary: Completion Reliability Contract

Add a new provider/runtime-scoped contract layer:

- `CompletionReliabilityManifest`

This belongs beside existing completion manifests, but serves a different purpose.

Existing manifest answers:

- what completion family the provider belongs to
- what selector family / source kind is expected

New reliability manifest answers:

- what runtime artifacts must exist
- what the primary authority source is
- what secondary evidence sources may be consulted
- whether empty-reply terminalization is allowed
- what no-progress / no-terminal deadlines apply
- what degraded terminal reason to emit when primary completion authority never arrives

### 6.1 Suggested Fields

- `provider`
- `runtime_mode`
- `primary_authority`
  - `protocol_log`
  - `hook_artifact`
  - `session_event_log`
- `required_runtime_artifacts`
  - directories/files expected immediately after launch
- `optional_secondary_sources`
  - `session_log`
  - `pane_capture`
  - `hook_artifact`
  - `protocol_log`
- `allow_empty_terminal_reply`
- `empty_reply_requires_secondary_evidence`
- `no_progress_timeout_s`
- `no_terminal_timeout_s`
- `timeout_terminal_status`
  - usually `incomplete`
- `timeout_terminal_reason`
  - for example `completion_timeout`
- `supports_degraded_pane_capture`

The manifest must be provider-owned data, not inferred ad hoc in CLI code.

## 7. New Boundary: Completion Reliability Monitor

Add a control-plane-owned component in the execution layer:

- `CompletionReliabilityMonitor`

This component must live with provider execution, not in CLI, and not in generic dispatcher routing.

### 7.1 Responsibility

For each active submission, it tracks:

- when the job started
- when runtime bootstrap was confirmed
- when the last progress evidence arrived
- when the last primary-authority evidence arrived
- whether the latest evidence is exact / observed / degraded
- whether the request is past no-progress or no-terminal deadlines

It does not parse provider-specific logs itself.

Instead:

- provider adapters keep parsing provider-native streams
- the monitor evaluates reliability state and closure policy using normalized evidence facts

### 7.2 State Model

Each active submission should expose reliability facts in runtime state:

- `completion_bootstrap_state`
  - `pending`
  - `ready`
  - `failed`
- `completion_primary_state`
  - `waiting`
  - `observed`
  - `terminal`
  - `missing`
- `completion_last_progress_at`
- `completion_last_primary_evidence_at`
- `completion_last_secondary_evidence_at`
- `completion_timeout_deadline_at`
- `completion_reliability_reason`

### 7.3 Terminalization Rule

Default rule:

- a managed pane-backed submission may remain active indefinitely when
  `no_terminal_timeout_s <= 0`
- default runtime behavior should prefer waiting for provider/completion
  authority over synthesizing a timeout when later agent-health detection can
  handle stuck agents separately

Opt-in degraded closure:

- a managed pane-backed submission with `no_terminal_timeout_s > 0` may not
  remain active indefinitely after that deadline without valid primary
  authority

When an opt-in deadline is exceeded, the monitor must produce a terminal
decision.
Provider-native cursor movement, polling timestamps, rescan offsets, and other
reader bookkeeping are not progress evidence and must not extend the deadline.
Only semantic evidence such as request anchor observation, assistant reply text,
terminal artifacts, or provider turn binding should refresh progress.
Session snapshot/rotation bookkeeping is observable state, but it is not
completion progress by itself.

Opt-in degraded closure result:

- `status = incomplete`
- `reason = completion_timeout`
- `confidence = degraded`

If a provider-specific secondary source supports extracting a best-effort reply safely, that reply may be attached with clear degraded diagnostics.

Running-job heartbeat is a separate no-progress diagnostics guard:

- heartbeat observations remain internal diagnostics/events rather than caller-visible replies
- default job heartbeat does not terminalize running `ask` jobs; CCB keeps waiting for provider execution or completion-tracker authority
- `heartbeat_timeout` terminalization is opt-in/health-gated behavior and must not be used as a blind replacement for provider reliability decisions
- when an opt-in timeout policy is enabled, a real terminal provider reply before that threshold remains the only normal caller-facing reply

## 8. New Boundary: Runtime Artifact Layout Contract

Provider launchers must no longer hand-roll runtime file names in multiple places.

Introduce one canonical artifact-layout helper per provider runtime.

### 8.1 Codex

Add a canonical helper such as:

- `codex_runtime_artifact_layout(runtime_dir)`

It must own all runtime paths:

- `input.fifo`
- `output.fifo`
- `bridge.pid`
- `bridge.stdout.log`
- `bridge.stderr.log`
- canonical bridge terminal log
- `completion/`

All of these must be consumed from that helper by:

- launcher payload builder
- bridge env builder
- bridge runtime state
- diagnostics renderers

String literals for these names must not be duplicated across modules.

### 8.2 Hook Providers

Add equivalent helpers for:

- `gemini`
- `claude`

The helper must own:

- `completion/`
- `completion/events/`
- optional auxiliary diagnostics files if introduced later

### 8.3 Boot Validation

Provider startup must assert declared artifacts exist immediately after launch preparation.

Failure mode must be:

- runtime launch degraded / failed

not:

- accept jobs and wait forever

## 9. New Boundary: Turn-Scoped Hook Evidence

Single-file terminal overwrite is too weak for hook-driven providers.

Replace the hook completion model with an append-oriented turn evidence model.

### 9.1 Current Weakness

Current file:

- `completion/events/<req_id>.json`

stores only the latest terminal interpretation.

That loses:

- whether the hook fired multiple times
- whether an empty-reply artifact arrived before a later real reply
- whether the artifact belonged to an auth/info turn versus the request answer turn

### 9.2 Target Model

Use an append-only per-request ledger, for example:

- `completion/events/<req_id>.jsonl`

Each record should include:

- `event_kind`
  - `hook_seen`
  - `hook_empty_reply`
  - `hook_failure`
  - `hook_completed`
  - `hook_cancelled`
- `req_id`
- `provider_turn_ref`
- `session_id`
- `session_path`
- `reply`
- `reply_text_present`
- `hook_event_name`
- `diagnostics`
- `timestamp`

The poller may still synthesize one terminal decision, but the authority read path must be able to distinguish:

- empty informational hook
- wrong-turn hook
- genuine answer completion

## 10. Provider-Specific Repair Plan

### 10.1 Codex

Codex does not need to be forced into the Gemini/Claude hook model.

Its design should remain:

- primary authority = protocol/session log

But reliability must be fixed in two places.

#### 10.1.1 Fix Runtime Layout Split

Current split:

- launcher/session payload uses `bridge_output.log`
- bridge runtime writes `bridge.log`

This must be unified by canonical layout helper.

Phase 1 chooses:

- canonical Codex bridge terminal log = `bridge.log`

Backward-compatible migration:

- choose one canonical file name
- optionally preserve the old name as a symlink or compatibility alias for one release cycle

#### 10.1.2 Create Declared Runtime Artifacts Up Front

Ensure startup explicitly creates:

- `completion/`
- canonical bridge log path
- other declared runtime files/directories

even if Codex completion does not primarily consume hook artifacts.

This keeps diagnostics and contract shape coherent.

#### 10.1.3 Add Bootstrap Self-Test

Immediately after bridge spawn, validate:

- bridge pid file exists
- bridge log path exists or is writable
- declared runtime artifacts exist

If not:

- mark startup degraded / failed
- do not accept async jobs silently

#### 10.1.4 Recover Stale Bound Session Logs Safely

Codex completion polling may encounter a stale bound session file when the
provider has switched to a new managed session log but the bridge-side binding
tracker did not update `.codex-*-session`.

The completion reader must not globally weaken bound-session isolation. Instead,
while an active job has not yet observed its request anchor, it may switch away
from the bound log only when all of these are true:

- the current bound log has no unread bytes at the captured cursor
- exactly one other log under the same managed Codex session root has matching
  workspace `cwd`
- that candidate log contains the active request anchor
- the candidate has a parseable Codex session id, so subsequent reads remain
  locked to that exact session

This is a completion-layer recovery path, not a replacement for bridge health
supervision. Bridge/helper death or a missing `CCB_SESSION_FILE` should still be
reported as a binding-health problem.

#### 10.1.5 Separate Prompt Delivery Acceptance From Completion Timeout

Codex pane-backed submission has two distinct failure boundaries:

- prompt delivery acceptance: the wrapped prompt must appear in a valid Codex
  protocol log as the active `CCB_REQ_ID`
- completion: after acceptance, Codex must eventually emit assistant/terminal
  evidence for that accepted turn

`running` at the dispatcher layer only means CCB has started the attempt and
sent text toward the pane. It must not be treated as proof that Codex accepted a
protocol turn.

For wrapped Codex turns, submission records `delivery_state = pending_anchor`
until the request anchor is observed. A Codex-specific delivery guard may
terminalize with `reason = codex_prompt_delivery_failed` only when all of these
hold:

- the job is still active, wrapped, and has not observed the request anchor
- the originally bound/current log is drained at the captured cursor, so the
  stale-session fallback has had a chance to run
- no unique newer top-level fallback log under the same agent-managed Codex
  session root contains the exact active request anchor; an exact anchor may
  override stale `cwd` metadata left by `/clear`, but never the managed-root or
  top-level-session boundary
- there is hard evidence that the pane cannot accept the prompt (`Shutting down`
  / `Pane is dead`) or the conservative delivery timeout has elapsed

When that unique exact-anchor fallback exists, the adapter must commit the new
session binding transactionally before polling it: persist the new path/id,
old-binding metadata, and resume command; validate that the candidate still
exists; then replace the in-memory reader. Failed or concurrent persistence
must leave the old binding intact and fail closed rather than polling one log
while the session file names another. Candidate discovery remains off the
steady-state path: it is allowed only while a wrapped delivery is awaiting its
anchor and the bound log is drained.

Reply delivery has the same acceptance boundary. Sending `CCB_REPLY` text to a
pane is not delivery completion. Codex reply-delivery prompts must carry their
own request anchor, remain running after pane dispatch, and consume the mailbox
head only after that exact anchor is observed in the bound protocol log.
The resulting provider acknowledgement is transport work, not a second
business response, so it may be empty only when all delivery proofs agree:
the runtime is explicitly marked for reply delivery, its state is `accepted`,
the request anchor was observed, and the terminal decision is exactly
`reply_delivery_sent` with accepted-delivery diagnostics. Missing any one of
those proofs keeps the normal non-empty-reply fail-closed gate. A confirmed
transport acknowledgement must not be downgraded to
`task_complete_empty_reply`, because terminal reply-delivery recovery would
otherwise requeue the same mailbox head indefinitely.

The first implementation must not automatically resend the prompt. Anchor
absence is observation failure, not proof that Codex never began executing.
Diagnostics should expose `delivery_failure_kind`, `delivery_retryable`, the
checked log/workspace paths, and the delivery timeout so operators can choose an
explicit retry without risking duplicate downstream side effects.

#### 10.1.6 Fence Native Subagent Completion From CCB Replies

Codex native subagents may create a second rollout under the managed agent's
private session root with the same workspace `cwd`. When the native child forks
the parent conversation it may also inherit the active `CCB_REQ_ID`, while
emitting its own `task_started`, collaboration messages, and `task_complete`.
That child evidence is not completion authority for the CCB job assigned to the
parent Codex agent.

The Codex adapter must enforce both boundaries:

- session binding excludes rollouts identified by
  `session_meta.thread_source = subagent` or equivalent native subagent
  provenance from scanning, watchdog updates, persistence, rotation, and
  recovery
- completion binds the top-level parent `turn_id` once and ignores assistant or
  terminal events carrying a different turn id; native collaboration
  `agent_message` content must not enter the reply buffer

The callback/mailbox layer continues routing by the original CCB job lineage.
It must never need to infer native provider parentage from reply text. Both
plain `ask` and `ask --chain` therefore receive only the CCB target agent's
top-level final reply, not a native subagent result.

### 10.2 Gemini

Gemini currently has the most fragile turn attribution.

#### 10.2.1 Strengthen Req-ID Ownership

Hook processing must not infer `completed` merely from "some request id was present in prompt text".

Required conditions for exact completion:

- artifact req_id matches the active request anchor
- hook event is associated with the current provider turn
- reply is non-empty, or provider diagnostics explicitly declare a valid empty terminal turn

If these are not all true:

- do not emit exact `completed`
- record degraded hook evidence instead

#### 10.2.2 Empty Reply Must Not Burn The Job

Current `reply = "[no response text]"` style terminalization should be demoted unless positively proven valid.

Default rule:

- empty reply + no assistant-visible content = `incomplete`, not `completed`
- Claude and Gemini hook readers must also normalize legacy or malformed
  `completed` + empty-reply hook events into terminal `incomplete` decisions
  with `empty_reply`, `empty_provider_reply`, and a human-readable diagnosis.
- Protocol-turn providers such as managed Codex must normalize
  `task_complete` boundaries with no boundary reply and no prior
  assistant-visible reply evidence into terminal `incomplete` decisions with
  the same empty-reply diagnostic shape.
- Native-transcript providers such as Antigravity (`agy`) must normalize
  native completed/finished evidence with no extracted assistant reply into
  terminal `incomplete` decisions immediately, rather than completing or
  waiting for a long timeout.

#### 10.2.3 API Failure And Long-Thinking Need Closure

If Gemini shows:

- transport/API failure
- long-thinking stall
- hook absence beyond timeout

then the reliability monitor must terminalize with:

- `status = incomplete`
- `reason = completion_timeout` or `api_error`

depending on observed diagnostics

This must happen without requiring `ccb kill -f`.

### 10.3 Claude

Claude should adopt the same reliability plane as Gemini, even if the current public issue is narrower.

Required:

- same append-only hook evidence model
- same empty-terminal guard
- same timeout closure
- same diagnostics surface

Claude-specific session-boundary logic may still provide stronger observed completion than Gemini, but must no longer rely on hook exactness alone.

### 10.4 OpenCode And Kimi Session Binding (Added 2026-06-03)

In addition to the timeout/closure concerns above, all three managed providers
(Claude, OpenCode, Kimi) share a session-binding staleness defect that Codex
already fixed in ISSUE-017.

**Defect**: After long idle periods where the provider CLI creates a new local
session, the execution adapter's reader continues to reference the old session
binding. When the polling loop or reader detects the new session, it resets
state (offset, session_updated, assistant_count) in ways that cause ALL
historical messages to be re-read and emitted as "current" completions.

**Fix Applied**: Each provider's `poll()` now calls
`_refresh_reader_for_current_session_binding()` before reading, following the
Codex pattern. When the on-disk session binding differs from the reader's
cached binding, the reader is rebuilt and state is captured from end-of-file,
preventing old messages from being mistaken for new results.

**Files Changed**:

- `lib/provider_backends/claude/execution.py` — added refresh function + wired into poll
- `lib/provider_backends/claude/comm_runtime/polling_runtime/common.py` — offset fix
- `lib/provider_backends/claude/execution_runtime/start.py` — workspace_path in runtime_state
- `lib/provider_backends/opencode/execution.py` — added refresh function + wired into poll
- `lib/provider_backends/opencode/execution_runtime/start.py` — workspace_path in runtime_state
- `lib/provider_backends/opencode/runtime/reply_polling_runtime/loop.py` — session_entry pass-through
- `lib/provider_backends/opencode/runtime/reply_polling_runtime/state.py` — session_updated fix
- `lib/provider_backends/kimi/execution.py` — added refresh function + wired into poll + workspace_path

This is tracked as ISSUE-020 in `docs/ccbd-manual-test-issue-log.md`.

## 11. Placement In Code

### 11.1 Completion Manifest Layer

Add reliability manifest data near provider manifest / completion manifest definitions.

Likely modules:

- `lib/completion/`
- `lib/provider_core/`
- provider-specific `manifest.py`

### 11.2 Execution Layer

Add reliability monitor in provider execution service path.

Likely modules:

- `lib/provider_execution/service.py`
- `lib/provider_execution/service_runtime/`

This is the correct layer because it already owns:

- active submissions
- polling cadence
- persisted execution state

### 11.3 Provider-Specific Readers

Provider readers remain provider-owned.

Likely modules:

- `lib/provider_backends/codex/execution_runtime/`
- `lib/provider_backends/gemini/execution_runtime/`
- `lib/provider_backends/claude/execution_runtime/`
- `bin/ccb-provider-finish-hook`
- `lib/provider_hooks/artifacts_runtime/`

Managed Claude preparation also owns one legacy completion-hook migration. An
existing project or local Claude settings file may contain the old CCB command
shape `python .../ccb-provider-finish-hook`, which asks Python to parse the
extensionless Bash launcher. Preparation must remove only that CCB-specific
Python-wrapped finish/activity command, preserve unrelated hooks and settings,
and install the current direct launcher command in the managed Claude home.

### 11.4 Diagnostics Layer

Expose reliability state in:

- `ccb ping <agent>`
- `ccb doctor`
- support bundle artifacts

Useful fields:

- `completion_primary_authority`
- `completion_primary_state`
- `completion_bootstrap_state`
- `completion_last_progress_at`
- `completion_timeout_deadline_at`
- `completion_reliability_reason`
- `completion_fallback_source`

## 12. Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Codex

Add tests for:

- canonical runtime artifact layout is consistent across launcher / bridge / session payload
- declared `completion/` and bridge log path exist after startup
- startup fails clearly if canonical artifact path cannot be provisioned

### 12.2 Gemini

Add tests for:

- hook event with wrong `req_id` does not terminalize another job
- empty reply hook produces degraded / incomplete, not completed
- no hook after API failure converges to timeout terminal decision
- long-thinking without hook converges to timeout terminal decision

### 12.3 Claude

Add tests for:

- empty hook reply does not burn job
- session-boundary and hook evidence merge correctly
- timeout closure works when hook never arrives

### 12.4 Cross-Provider Reliability

Add execution-layer tests for:

- active job cannot remain `running` forever without primary completion evidence
- reliability timeout is provider-manifest-driven
- degraded fallback decision is persisted and restorable

## 13. Rollout Phases

### Phase 1

- introduce document and reliability boundary
- fix Codex runtime artifact layout split
- add bootstrap assertions for declared runtime artifacts

### Phase 2

- add reliability manifest and execution-layer monitor
- add no-terminal timeout closure

### Phase 3

- migrate Gemini / Claude hook artifacts from one-shot terminal file to append-oriented evidence
- strengthen req-id / turn attribution

### Phase 4

- expose diagnostics
- run macOS end-to-end validation

## 14. Immediate Design Conclusions

The correct architectural reading of issues `#180` and `#181` is:

- they are not identical provider bugs
- they are the same reliability-class bug

More precisely:

```text
#180 = runtime artifact contract split
#181 = hook-turn attribution and no-terminal-timeout gap
shared parent = missing managed-provider completion reliability plane
```

Therefore the repair plan must not be:

- "patch Codex log filename here"
- "patch Gemini hook parser there"
- "add one more mac-only timeout in CLI"

The repair plan must be:

- define one reliability contract
- validate runtime artifacts at launch
- preserve provider-specific completion families
- add one control-plane-owned timeout closure path
- make hook evidence turn-scoped instead of blindly terminal

## 15. Callback Ask Continuations

Nested synchronous `ask` is not a supported completion model. When agent A is
running an active mailbox request, a normal child ask to agent B can complete
and queue a `TASK_REPLY` back to A, but that reply cannot be delivered while
A's active request is still the mailbox head. Agents must not wait or poll for
that child reply inside the same turn.

`ccb ask --chain <target>` provides the stable handoff for this case:

- it is valid only from an agent that currently owns an active parent job
- the child request is recorded with a durable callback edge
- the parent job may complete as delegated and suppress normal reply delivery
- the parent message remains open until a continuation attempt produces the
  final reply
- the child result is recorded as a `ReplyRecord` but is not delivered as a
  normal `TASK_REPLY` to the parent agent
- when the child logical message reaches a terminal reply, CCB submits a normal
  `callback_continuation` `TASK_REQUEST` back to the parent agent
- the continuation uses the original caller as `from_actor`, preserving the
  normal final reply routing path

While an agent owns an active parent job, CCB rejects plain nested `ask`
submissions unless they are explicitly `--chain` or `--silence`. This guard
keeps accidental nested dependencies from completing into an undeliverable
`TASK_REPLY`; `--chain` is for needed child results, and `--silence` is for
independent no-result-needed work.

The first supported callback model is intentionally narrow:

- one outstanding callback child per parent job
- no inline provider-pane injection
- no mailbox FIFO bypass
- no fan-out / fan-in aggregation
- nested callback chains are supported because each level is a normal
  delegated parent plus later continuation
- a `callback_continuation` job must finish in its current turn; it may not
  create a new `--chain` edge back to that continuation's original caller

Durability is owned by callback edge records under the ccbd mailbox state. A
callback edge records the parent job/message, child job/message, original
caller, callback target, child reply id/status, continuation job/message, and
state. Dispatcher maintenance must repair the crash window where the child
reply was recorded and the continuation was not yet submitted. Repair is
idempotent: an edge with an existing continuation job is not submitted again.

Callback edge state is also the backend safety boundary for nested delegation.
Edges must carry a timeout deadline, and dispatcher maintenance must transition
expired pending edges to a terminal timeout state, persist a failed reply on the
parent message, and deliver that failure to the original caller when the caller
owns a mailbox. Callback submission must enforce a bounded chain depth and
reject actor cycles before creating the child job. Callback submission from a
continuation job must resolve `route_options.callback_edge_id` through callback
edge storage and reject attempts to `--chain` the edge's original caller; the
continuation completion itself is the upstream delivery path. If continuation
submission fails after the child has completed, the edge must transition to a
terminal failed state and the parent message must not remain indefinitely
running.
