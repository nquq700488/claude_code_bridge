# Current Project Structure

This document records the current repo layout after the agent-first
provider-backend migration cleanup.

It is intentionally practical: it describes what exists now, which
directories are part of the active runtime, and where the largest
remaining structural debt still sits.

The current runtime authority is `ccbd`. Some deeper historical sections
below still mention older `askd` naming where the full document rewrite
has not yet landed; treat those as migration debt, not current authority.

## Runtime Spine

The current agent-first runtime flows through this chain:

```text
ccb
  -> lib/cli/*
  -> lib/ccbd/*
  -> lib/provider_execution/*
  -> lib/completion/*
  -> lib/storage/* + lib/project/* + lib/workspace/*
```

The root entrypoint is now intentionally thin:

- `ccb`
  compatibility facade plus CLI handoff
- `lib/launcher/app.py`
  launcher compatibility composition root for pane/session-oriented legacy surfaces
- `lib/launcher/bootstrap/`
  launcher bootstrap contracts, lifecycle adapters, and service wiring
- `lib/launcher/bootstrap/builders/`
  grouped service-construction builders for core/store/launcher/runup assembly
- `lib/launcher/app_deps.py`
  compatibility wrapper for bootstrap dependency bindings
- `lib/launcher/app_project.py`
  project/config/session-path helpers
- `lib/launcher/app_runtime.py`
  pane/session/runtime helper mixin for the compatibility launcher shell
- `lib/launcher/app_facade.py`
  compatibility wrapper for launcher facade mixins
- `lib/launcher/facade/`
  provider-facing facade helpers and mixins grouped by tmux/current-pane/claude concerns
  target-facing facade wrappers are now grouped under
  `launcher/facade/targets_runtime/`; `targets.py` remains a stable
  re-export surface
- `lib/launcher/commands/`
  provider-specific start-command and resume/autoconfig helpers
- `lib/launcher/commands/providers/`
  per-provider launcher command builders and resume/config detection split by provider
- `lib/launcher/commands/factory.py`
  launcher start-command factory implementation; top-level `start_commands.py` remains compatibility-only
  Codex provider internals are now split between history detection, auto-approval config, and command assembly
  OpenCode provider internals are now split between resume detection, local config mutation, and command assembly
- `lib/launcher/ops/`
  target start operations split by tmux/current-pane/claude flows
- `lib/launcher/ops/current/`
  current-pane target operations split by codex, shell-like targets, and router dispatch
- `lib/launcher/maintenance/`
  path normalization, shell command builders, runtime helpers, and runtime cleanup
- `lib/launcher/maintenance/runtime/`
  runtime env parsing, git metadata, temp cleanup, runtime GC, and log shrink helpers
- `lib/launcher/session/`
  launcher session JSON I/O, registry payload builders, and provider-specific session metadata helpers
  target-session writes and registry update paths are further separated so store classes stay coordination-focused
- `lib/launcher/app_bootstrap.py`
  compatibility re-export layer

The provider layer is split into:

```text
lib/provider_core/*
lib/provider_backends/<provider>/*
lib/provider_backends/pane_log_support/*
```

Meaning:

- `provider_core` holds shared provider metadata, runtime specs, and registry contracts
- `provider_backends` owns backend-specific session, protocol, comm, and
  execution helpers
- `provider_backends/pane_log_support/` holds shared raw pane-log reader
  and communicator base logic for shell-style providers that do not emit
  structured session logs
- `provider_execution` is the runtime-facing execution layer used by the
  agent-first flow

## Directory Roles

### Active runtime directories

- `lib/cli/`
  phase-2 parsing, rendering, context construction, and non-phase2
  command routing
  phase-2 reply/mailbox/ops rendering is now grouped under
  `cli/render_runtime/`, leaving `render.py` as the stable render facade
  instead of another mixed output-formatting file
  mailbox/job/trace/ack render helpers there are now also grouped under
  `cli/render_runtime/mailbox_views_runtime/`, leaving
  `render_runtime/mailbox_views.py` as the stable mailbox-render facade
  instead of a flat multi-view formatter
  phase-2 command dispatch, context bootstrap, reset confirmation, and
  handler routing are now grouped under `cli/phase2_runtime/`, leaving
  `phase2.py` as the stable entry facade and monkeypatch surface
  kill-command zombie cleanup, provider session teardown, and daemon
  termination helpers are now grouped under `cli/kill_runtime/`,
  leaving `cli/kill.py` as the stable command facade and monkeypatch
  surface
  phase-2 project kill shutdown preparation, pid ownership cleanup, and
  shutdown-report assembly are now also grouped under
  `cli/services/kill_runtime/`, leaving `services/kill.py` as the
  stable project-kill facade and monkeypatch surface
  project-kill pid candidate collection, procfs matching, and
  termination helpers now also reuse the shared
  `runtime_pid_cleanup/` package so CLI shutdown does not own a second
  copy of project pid-lifecycle logic
  tmux project-pane enumeration, socket-aware orphan cleanup, and
  current-pane-last kill ordering are now also grouped under
  `cli/services/tmux_project_cleanup_runtime/`, leaving
  `services/tmux_project_cleanup.py` as the stable cleanup facade and
  monkeypatch surface for tmux availability/current-pane tests

  facade for management command handlers
  remote tag fetch, release metadata transport, and local version-format
  helpers there are now further grouped under
  `cli/management_runtime/versioning_runtime/`, leaving

  separating ask/start parsing, shared argparse helpers, general
  subcommand parsers, and fault parsing so `cli/parser.py` stays as the
  stable phase-2 facade
  start-time project-config validation, provider parsing, lock reuse,
  and selection helpers are now grouped under `cli/start_runtime/`,
  leaving `cli/start.py` as the stable start helper facade

  surface for startup/keeper tests
  runtime launcher pane creation/fallback and session-file writes are

  selection, and monkeypatch-stable wrapper helpers
  tmux binding liveness checks and stale-pane cleanup there are now
  further grouped under
  `cli/services/runtime_launch_runtime/binding_state_runtime/`, leaving
  `binding_state.py` as the stable binding-state facade instead of a
  mixed liveness/cleanup helper
  runtime-binding liveness and stale-pane cleanup there are now also
  grouped under package-local runtime modules, so the public
  `runtime_launch.py` surface keeps test/compat injection points
  without owning the full branchy launch gate logic
  async wait polling, quorum policy, and reply reduction are now also
  grouped under `cli/services/wait_runtime/`, leaving `services/wait.py`
  as the stable wait facade and monkeypatch surface
  provider session binding lookup now treats
  `services/provider_binding.py` as a thin compatibility facade over the
  shared `provider_core/session_binding_evidence.py` adapter instead of a
  CLI-owned authority source
- `lib/ccbd/`
  project-scoped control plane for startup, supervision, namespace
  lifecycle, dispatcher flow, and shutdown/reporting
  keeper state records, shutdown intent persistence, and restart/backoff
  helpers are now grouped under `ccbd/keeper_runtime/`, leaving
  `keeper.py` focused on the project keeper loop and the test-visible
  process helpers that still need a stable monkeypatch surface
  lifecycle report model families are now grouped under
  `ccbd/models_runtime/lifecycle_runtime/`, separating cleanup-summary,
  runtime-snapshot, startup-report, and shutdown-report schemas so
  `models_runtime/lifecycle.py` stays as the stable lifecycle-model
  facade instead of a single record pile
  ping payload assembly and summary-store reads are now grouped under
  `ccbd/handlers/ping_runtime/`, leaving `handlers/ping.py` as the
  stable ping-handler facade instead of mixing agent/daemon payload
  shaping with store reads
  per-agent startup preparation is now grouped in
  `ccbd/start_preparation.py`, leaving `start_flow.py` focused on startup
  orchestration, layout application, runtime attach, and cleanup
  startup runtime details are now grouped under `ccbd/start_runtime/`,
  separating tmux layout gating, provider-binding usability checks,
  cmd-pane bootstrap, per-agent runtime attach, and start-time orphan
  cleanup from the stable `start_flow.py` facade
  project-namespace binding validation, socket declaration reads, and
  pane relabel/start hints there are now further grouped under
  `ccbd/start_runtime/binding_runtime/`, leaving
  `start_runtime/binding.py` as the stable binding facade instead of
  another flat evidence file
  supervision recovery, mount, and backoff logic are now grouped under
  `ccbd/supervision/*.py`, leaving `supervision/loop.py` as the stable
  heartbeat/reconcile facade instead of a flat state-machine file
  stop-all shutdown execution and pid/tmux cleanup are now grouped in
  `ccbd/stop_flow.py`, leaving `supervisor.py` focused on orchestration
  and lifecycle reporting
  supervisor namespace handoff, start/stop orchestration, and
  startup/shutdown report assembly are now also grouped under
  `ccbd/supervisor_runtime/`, leaving `supervisor.py` as the stable
  orchestration facade and monkeypatch surface for start-flow tests
  stop-time runtime selection, pid cleanup, tmux orphan cleanup, and
  shutdown snapshot helpers are now further grouped under
  `ccbd/stop_flow_runtime/`, so `stop_flow.py` stays as the stable
  shutdown facade instead of another mixed teardown file
  daemon stop-flow pid candidate collection, procfs reads, and
  termination helpers there now also reuse the shared
  `runtime_pid_cleanup/` package so ccbd and CLI shutdown paths consume
  one project-pid ownership implementation
  provider pane assessment for health supervision is now grouped under
  `ccbd/services/health_assessment/`, leaving
  `services/health_runtime.py` as the stable assessment facade; health
  monitor orchestration, pane-state routing, and runtime update helpers
  are now grouped under `ccbd/services/health_monitor_runtime/`,
  leaving `services/health.py` as the stable health-monitor facade
  degraded-state field updates, rebind writes, and provider-fact
  projection there are now further grouped under
  `ccbd/services/health_monitor_runtime/updates_runtime/`, so the
  health-monitor facade no longer mixes degraded-pane state retention
  with rebind/update helper details
  dispatcher start/recovery/queue tick helpers are now grouped under
  `ccbd/services/dispatcher_runtime/lifecycle_start_runtime/`, leaving
  `dispatcher_runtime/lifecycle_start.py` as the stable dispatcher

  facade instead of another mixed mailbox/payload file
  runtime attach, restore/readiness, and provider-binding refresh flows
  are now grouped under `ccbd/services/runtime_runtime/`, leaving
  `services/runtime.py` as the stable service facade instead of a mixed
  lifecycle/state-update file
  tmux-specific pane backend/ownership/namespace checks for health
  assessment are now also grouped under

  facade
- `lib/askd/`
  project-scoped ask daemon app, socket server/client, handlers, mount
  state, and restore paths
  `askd.client` is now mostly a legacy facade over
  `askd/client_runtime/`; provider wrapper main paths have been moved to
  native askd socket jobs, and the remaining facade usage is isolated to
  compat/diagnostic surfaces pending retirement
  `askd.server` is now a package facade over `askd/server_runtime/`
  environment, handler, state-write, server bootstrap, and lifecycle
  monitor modules
  standalone askd worker routing, request handling, and runtime
  state cleanup now live under `askd/daemon_runtime/`, leaving
  `askd/daemon.py` as the standalone askd entry facade
  dispatcher coordination internals are now grouped under
  `askd/services/dispatcher_runtime/` so `services/dispatcher.py`
  stays focused on submit/tick/complete orchestration; polling, restore
  replay, watch-target routing, and completion-state helpers now live in
  package-local runtime modules there
  submit/tick lifecycle orchestration and cancel-terminalization helpers
  are now further separated into dedicated `dispatcher_runtime/`
  modules, reducing `services/dispatcher.py` to the dispatcher facade
  and shared store/runtime helpers
  Claude adapter reply-shaping and wait/finalize helpers are now grouped
  under `askd/adapters/claude_runtime/`, leaving
  `askd/adapters/claude.py` as a provider-facing orchestration facade
  Claude reply postprocessing there is now further separated into intent
  detection, table normalization, and format-repair modules so
  `claude_runtime/reply_postprocess.py` stays as the orchestration
  facade instead of a single rule pile
  Codex and Gemini ask-daemon wait/finalize flows are now also grouped
  under `askd/adapters/codex_runtime/` and

  also grouped under `askd/adapters/codebuddy_runtime/`,
  `askd/adapters/qwen_runtime/`, and `askd/adapters/copilot_runtime/`,
  leaving their adapter modules focused on session/backend wiring

  ask-daemon lease and restore-report dataclasses now also live under
  `askd/models_runtime/`, leaving `askd/models.py` as the stable schema
  facade
  `lib/ask_cli/` is now alias-only: `ask_cli.main` forwards `ask` to the
  canonical `ccb ask` phase-2 path, and programmatic callers no longer
  use a separate `ask_cli.runtime` helper layer
  legacy top-level `askd_client.py`, `askd_runtime.py`, and
  `askd_server.py` now remain as compatibility shims only
- `lib/agents/`
  agent config schema, runtime state records, restore checkpoints,
  policy defaults, and persistent stores

  with name normalization, enums, config dataclasses, and runtime
  dataclasses separated into package-local modules

  execution registry, provider adapters, state persistence, and restore
  orchestration
  execution-service replay/persist/restore flows now live under
  `provider_execution/service_runtime/`, leaving `service.py` as the
  stable coordination facade instead of the full state-machine body
  shared active-runtime start/poll/resume guards now live under

  focused on the public registry surface and default builder entrypoints
  provider session evidence extraction and pane-ownership-backed binding
  facts now also live under `provider_core/session_binding_evidence.py`

  record expansion, project-path lookup, and final fallback selection so
  `claude/resolver.py` stays as the stable facade
  Claude project-session model, load/fallback selection, and key
  derivation now also live under `provider_backends/claude/session_runtime/`,

  management are now separated into dedicated runtime modules there

  OpenCode session-file/runtime wiring and reader-support helpers now
  live under `provider_backends/opencode/runtime/`, leaving
  `opencode/comm.py` more focused on communicator orchestration while
  storage-backed session selection, message/part reads, polling, and
  cancel-detection helpers live in that runtime package
  OpenCode storage-reader internals are now further separated there into
  session lookup, message/part readers, and incremental state-capture
  modules so `runtime/storage_reader.py` remains a stable facade instead
  of accumulating all storage concerns directly
  OpenCode polling there is now further split between reply polling,
  conversation views, and cancel tracking so `runtime/polling.py`
  remains a stable facade instead of holding all live-read behavior
  OpenCode cancel tracking there is now further grouped under
  `runtime/cancel_tracking_runtime/`, separating aborted-assistant
  matching from log-cursor monitoring so `cancel_tracking.py` stays as a
  stable facade instead of another mixed live-state file

  startup and session-binding callbacks live under
  `provider_backends/droid/comm_runtime/watchdog.py`
  Droid reader internals are now further separated there into session
  selection, content extraction, and incremental polling modules so
  `comm_runtime/log_reader.py` stays as the stable reader facade instead
  of holding all reader behavior directly
  Droid parsing helpers there are now also grouped under
  `comm_runtime/parsing_runtime/`, separating path matching,
  session-start reads, and message-content extraction so `parsing.py`
  stays as the stable facade
  Droid active execution start/poll wiring now also lives under
  `provider_backends/droid/execution_runtime/`, leaving
  `droid/execution.py` as the stable adapter facade while start-flow
  setup, state/session helpers, and polling stay separated in

  now also live under `provider_backends/droid/comm_runtime/session_selection_runtime/`,
  leaving `session_selection.py` as the stable selection facade

  there are now also grouped under
  `provider_backends/droid/comm_runtime/polling_runtime/`, leaving

  now also live under `provider_backends/droid/session_runtime/`,
  leaving `droid/session.py` as the stable session facade
  Qwen, Copilot, and CodeBuddy pane-log parsing and session communicator
  mechanics are now consolidated under
  `provider_backends/pane_log_support/`, leaving each provider's
  `comm.py` as a thin provider-named facade over the shared pane-log
  support layer
- `lib/completion/`
  completion detectors, sources, selectors, and orchestration
  shared enums, dataclass records, and completion utility helpers are
  now grouped under `completion/models_runtime/`, leaving
  `completion/models.py` as the stable import facade for the rest of the
  runtime
  completion record dataclasses there are now further grouped under
  `completion/models_runtime/records_runtime/`, leaving
  `models_runtime/records.py` as the stable re-export facade instead of
  a single flat dataclass pile
- `lib/terminal_runtime/`
  pane-targeted tmux runtime helpers used by v2 paths
  `terminal.py` remains the monkeypatch-stable facade while backend
  selection and layout wiring now live under `terminal_facade/`
  tmux backend orchestration is now further grouped under
  `terminal_runtime/tmux_backend_runtime/`, separating service builders
  and pane/session actions so `tmux_backend.py` stays as the stable
  backend facade instead of a single broad coordination file
  tmux pane lookup, pane metadata reads, and pane mutation helpers are
  now also grouped under `terminal_runtime/tmux_panes_runtime/`, leaving
  `tmux_panes.py` as the stable pane-service facade instead of another

  pane-log root/path selection, trim policy, and stale-log cleanup are

  shared project-owned pid collection, procfs evidence reads, path
  ownership matching, pid-file cleanup, and termination helpers used by
  both CLI kill and ccbd stop-flow runtime paths
- `lib/storage/`, `lib/project/`, `lib/workspace/`

  instead of a single mixed replay file

  project root instead of assuming a global daemon context
  route-specific daemon/provider status logic is now grouped under
  `web/route_support/`, so route modules stay API-oriented
  mail route schemas, hook/service helpers, and daemon-control helpers
  are now grouped under `web/route_support/mail/`, leaving
  `web/routes/mail.py` as a route-only facade

### Still co-located but not part of the clean core

- `inherit_skills/`
  provider-specific prompt/skill assets installed by CCB and inherited by
  managed provider homes
- `bin/`
  legacy provider wrappers plus current helper scripts
- `mcp/ccb-delegation/`
  stdio MCP compatibility server; schema, tool-call handling, and
  JSON-RPC protocol helpers are now split into local runtime helper
  modules so `server.py` stays as the entry facade

## Current File-System Reading

The repo is materially cleaner than before, but still has three obvious
shape issues:

1. The root directory mixes runtime code, provider scripts, prompt
   assets, long-lived design docs, and generated analysis artifacts.
2. The active runtime is modular, but launcher bootstrap and terminal
   orchestration are still dense compared with the rest of the runtime.
3. Tests are broad and valuable, but blackbox coverage is concentrated in
   a single giant file: `test/test_v2_phase2_entrypoint.py`.

## Static Hotspots

Cached `.architec` outputs now report a still-weak but structurally
cleaner baseline:

- overall score: `45.04`
- governance overall: `29.38`
- structure: `60.70`
- largest debt dimensions: `cyclomatic_complexity`, `governance`, `wide_component`

Top cached hotspots:

1. `lib/ccbd/client_runtime/resolution.py`
2. `lib/ccbd/runtime.py`
3. `lib/ccbd/services/dispatcher_runtime/lifecycle_start_runtime/recovery.py`
4. `lib/ccbd/services/dispatcher_runtime/restore.py`
5. `lib/ccbd/services/runtime_runtime/restore.py`

The latest hotspot rounds retired `lib/ccbd/keeper.py`,
`lib/agents/config_loader_runtime/io.py`,
`lib/provider_backends/claude/registry_support/pathing.py`,
`lib/provider_backends/claude/session.py`, and
`lib/pane_registry_runtime/common.py` from the current top-five list.
At this point the remaining drag is concentrated in live `ccbd`
branching paths, not missing package boundaries.

## Largest Remaining Structural Debt

Based on the current tree and local scans, the next cleanup priority is:

1. Converge repeated execution/runtime semantics across
   `lib/provider_backends/*/execution.py`, especially where providers
   still duplicate hook ordering, restore decisions, and active-session
   guards around the shared execution contract; much of this is now
   moved into provider-local `execution_runtime/` packages, but the
   remaining duplication should be watched before it re-accumulates.
2. Refactor the new cyclomatic hotspots before they re-accumulate
   branch debt, especially
   `lib/ccbd/client_runtime/resolution.py`,
   `lib/ccbd/runtime.py`,
   `lib/ccbd/services/dispatcher_runtime/lifecycle_start_runtime/recovery.py`,
   `lib/ccbd/services/dispatcher_runtime/restore.py`, and
   `lib/ccbd/services/runtime_runtime/restore.py`.
3. Keep the remaining large provider/runtime modules under control so
   new orchestration work does not recreate another flat choke point,
   especially in `lib/terminal_runtime/tmux_backend.py`,
   `lib/opencode_runtime/paths_runtime/`, and any new runtime-local
   packages created under terminal management.
4. Watch the new `agents/config_loader_runtime/`,
   `agents/config_loader_runtime/io_runtime/`,
   `agents/config_loader_runtime/parsing_runtime/`,
   `ccbd/keeper_runtime/`, `cli/services/daemon_runtime/`,
   `pane_registry_runtime/common_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/claude/session_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/claude/registry_support/pathing_runtime/`,
   `askd/services/dispatcher_runtime/`, and
   `completion/models_runtime/records_runtime/` packages for
   second-order hotspots; the same applies now to
   `cli/kill_runtime/`, `cli/services/kill_runtime/`,
   `askd/models_runtime/`, `askd/adapters/codex_runtime/`,
   `provider_execution/active_runtime/`,
   `terminal_runtime/tmux_backend_runtime/`,
   `terminal_runtime/tmux_panes_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/codex/comm_runtime/binding_update_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/codex/comm_runtime/polling_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/codex/execution_runtime/state_machine_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/claude/registry_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/claude/registry_runtime/events_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/claude/registry_support/logs_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/claude/comm_runtime/communicator_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/claude/comm_runtime/parsing_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/claude/comm_runtime/session_selection_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/claude/execution_runtime/state_machine_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/gemini/comm_runtime/binding_update_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/gemini/comm_runtime/communicator_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/gemini/comm_runtime/session_selection_runtime/`,
   and `provider_backends/gemini/comm_runtime/polling_loop_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/droid/comm_runtime/parsing_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/opencode/runtime/cancel_tracking_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/droid/execution_runtime/`,
   `provider_backends/opencode/execution_runtime/`,
   `opencode_runtime/paths_runtime/`. If new policy, recovery, or
   serialization logic lands there, split by domain before those runtime
   packages start re-accumulating mixed responsibilities.
5. Keep the newly thin top-level facades stable; if more
   communication-layer cleanup is needed, prefer splitting runtime-local
   helper modules instead of re-growing `provider_backends/*/comm.py`.
6. Separate historical docs from current baseline docs so readers do not
   confuse old migration notes with the current runtime structure.

## Practical Navigation Guide

If you are changing agent-first runtime behavior, start here:

- `ccb`
- `lib/cli/phase2.py`
- `lib/cli/services/`
- `lib/askd/app.py`
- `lib/askd/services/`
- `lib/provider_execution/service.py`
- `lib/provider_execution/registry.py`
- `lib/provider_backends/<provider>/`

If you are changing startup and pane orchestration, start here:

- `ccb`
- `lib/cli/start.py`
- `lib/launcher/`
- `lib/launcher/app_bootstrap.py`
- `lib/terminal.py`
- `lib/terminal_runtime/`

If you are changing persistence or project binding, start here:

- `lib/project/`
- `lib/storage/`
- `lib/workspace/`
- `lib/pane_registry_runtime/`
- `lib/pane_registry.py`
- `lib/session_utils.py`

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep the agent-first path explicit and short.
- Prefer package-local modules over reintroducing giant top-level helper
  files.
- When a module becomes part of the stable package surface, export it
  explicitly from the package `__init__.py`.
- Keep generated artifacts and caches out of the repo root and out of git
  tracking.
