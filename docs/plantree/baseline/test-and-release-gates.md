# Test And Release Gates

Date: 2026-05-25

## Documentation Gates

- Markdown links introduced by the README refresh resolve locally.
- `README.md` and `README_zh.md` remain content-parity peers.
- Asset references load from the repo and include useful alt text.
- The README does not require private paths, private API keys, or local-only
  project names to understand examples.

## Config Example Gates

- Compact layout examples align with
  [ccb-config-layout-contract.md](../../ccb-config-layout-contract.md).
- `version = 2` windows examples do not mix legacy `cmd` with `[windows]`.
- Agent-local `key`, `url`, and `model` examples follow the shortcut contract.
- Worktree examples state the git repository requirement.

## Media Gates

- New screenshots and animations are captured from current v7 behavior or are
  explicitly labeled as mockups.
- Public media hides API keys, local tokens, private prompts, and irrelevant
  machine-specific paths.
- Each animation has a static fallback or nearby prose summary for readers who
  cannot view animated media.
- File sizes are checked before committing to avoid making the README slow to
  load.

## Suggested Verification

These are candidate gates for the README implementation phase; exact commands
should be confirmed before use:

- Markdown link check.
- README image path check.
- `ccb config validate` against documented config snippets if the command is
  available in the installed release.
- A smoke start against a temporary project when producing real screenshots or
  videos.

## Source Runtime Isolation Gates

- Source changes are validated with
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/ccb_test` from the dedicated default external
  project `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2`.
- Any other external source-test project must be explicitly allowed with
  `CCB_TEST_ROOTS` or `CCB_SOURCE_ALLOWED_ROOTS`; legacy sibling directories
  such as `test_ccb` and `ccb_test2` are not default roots.
- Stateful source validation does not run from
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source`, and `ccb_test --project` does not point at a
  path inside that checkout.
- Runbooks use the absolute source `ccb_test` wrapper or first record
  `command -v ccb_test` plus `readlink -f` so stale release/smoke wrappers on
  `PATH` cannot be mistaken for current source validation.
- `ccb_test --diagnose` reports the wrapper path, source `ccb`, effective
  roots, checked paths, and source-test allowance before stateful validation
  when wrapper or root selection is uncertain.
- Provider/account state for source runtime validation is isolated with
  `HOME=/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/source_home` and
  `CCB_SOURCE_HOME=/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/source_home`, unless the test
  intentionally covers inherited real provider configuration.
- `.ccb/agents/*` and `.ccb/ccbd/*` under the source checkout are treated as
  installed-release work-environment runtime state, not disposable source-test
  artifacts.
- `CCB_SOURCE_RUNTIME_OK=1` is a diagnostics-only override and must not be used
  for ordinary source validation.
