## Current Project Config Example

- The local `.ccb/ccb.config` used during planning had `version = 2` with
  multiple named windows, including a `readme` Codex agent. This is useful as a
  private reference for v7 README examples, but public docs should use
  sanitized examples instead of linking to this project-local runtime file.
