# Install Update Stability Plan

Date: 2026-06-04

## Purpose

Make CCB fresh install and managed update stable across supported user
environments. A successful install or update must leave the `ccb` entrypoint
usable, avoid repeated dependency or Role Pack installs when nothing changed,
handle legacy state without user-facing traceback-style failures, and render
the main user prompts in Chinese or English.

This plan covers installer shell behavior, `ccb update`, post-update
provisioning, managed tools, Role Packs, and validation. It is intentionally
separate from the Role Pack plan: Role Packs define role semantics, while this
plan defines installation and update resilience.

## File Map

- [roadmap.md](roadmap.md): implementation sequence and open release gates.
- [topics/install-update-flow.md](topics/install-update-flow.md): end-to-end
  flow from fresh install through tarball update and post-update provisioning.
- [topics/environment-and-scenario-matrix.md](topics/environment-and-scenario-matrix.md):
  supported platforms, install modes, user profiles, TTY modes, network
  states, and expected behavior.
- [topics/dependency-and-role-idempotency.md](topics/dependency-and-role-idempotency.md):
  no-repeat rules for Python packages, managed venv, Neovim, Role Packs, and
  role-owned tools.
- [topics/i18n-output-contract.md](topics/i18n-output-contract.md): Chinese
  and English output contract for installer/update prompts and diagnostics.
- [topics/validation-runbook.md](topics/validation-runbook.md): automated and
  real-environment validation commands before release.
- [history/v729-rolepack-update-failure-2026-06-04.md](history/v729-rolepack-update-failure-2026-06-04.md):
  incident note for the `ccb.archi` post-update Role Pack failure.

## Scope

In scope:

- `install.sh install` and `install.sh uninstall`.
- Managed `ccb update` on Linux, macOS, and WSL.
- Release tarball extraction and staged installer handoff.
- Source/dev install behavior where global wrappers point at a live checkout.
- Python selection, managed venv, entrypoint smoke checks, root/sudo profile
  warnings, WSL confirmation, and tmux/provider prerequisites.
- Optional dependency provisioning: `tomli`, `watchdog`, Droid MCP, Neovim, and
  Role Packs.
- Post-update Role Pack refresh and legacy id migration such as
  `ccb.archi -> agentroles.archi`.
- Chinese and English user-visible install/update prompts, warnings, and next
  actions.

Out of scope:

- Windows-native managed update.
- Automatically changing user shell rc files beyond existing PATH guidance.
- Rewriting provider-native installers for Codex, Claude, Gemini, or
  OpenCode.
- Automatically merging root-owned and normal-user profiles.
- Background automatic Role Pack updates outside explicit install/update
  commands.

## Non-Drift Contract

- Core install/update success must not depend on optional Role Pack, Neovim,
  Droid, or network provisioning success unless the user explicitly requested a
  required install mode.
- Post-update provisioning must run with the newly installed `ccb` code, not
  the old updater process, once the staged installer has completed.
- Already-current dependencies and Role Packs must be reported as checked or
  current, not reinstalled.
- Legacy installed state must be canonicalized before provisioning. New writes
  use `agentroles.archi`; `ccb.archi` remains an input compatibility alias
  only.
- Every interactive prompt that affects install/update behavior must have
  Chinese and English text selected by `CCB_LANG` or locale detection.
