# Managed Provider And Job Integrity

Date: 2026-07-21

## Purpose

Coordinate the correctness repairs identified while reviewing PR257 through
PR266. The affected behavior crosses provider asset projection, native session
resume, provider-turn binding, job execution diagnostics, cancellation, and
active-job control, so this plan provides one ordered landing path without
replacing the narrower domain plans.

The primary invariant is that CCB must not lose, misattribute, or silently
overwrite provider or job state while trying to improve continuity or
diagnostics.

## Authority

Shipped behavior remains governed by the relevant product contracts:

- [Codex plugin projection](../../../codex-plugin-projection-plan.md)
- [Claude session isolation](../../../claude-session-isolation-contract.md)
- [Provider-state storage boundaries](../../../ccb-provider-state-storage-boundary-plan.md)
- [Managed provider completion](../../../managed-provider-completion-reliability-plan.md)
- [CCBD diagnostics](../../../ccbd-diagnostics-contract.md)
- [Sidebar integration](../../../ccb-agent-sidebar-integration-plan.md)

This plan owns repair ordering and acceptance gates only. A slice that changes
one of those contracts must update it in the same patch.

## Scope

In scope:

- Safe Codex plugin marketplace/cache projection after merged PR257.
- Claude plugin marketplace and cache discovery in managed isolated homes.
- Exact-session Kimi restart behavior without first-launch `--continue`.
- Correct Claude queued-prompt activation and turn attribution.
- Inbound reply-routing instructions from PR264.
- Correlated execution phases, stuck-job evidence, and client visibility.
- Cancellation terminalization, callback continuation, and empty control
  notice behavior.
- Capability-gated correction or follow-up delivery to an active job.
- Unit, replay, merged-main, external source-runtime, and release-gate evidence.

Out of scope:

- A general plugin manager or shared writable cache service.
- Automatic recovery for a merely suspected stuck job in the first slice.
- Provider substitution or retry that hides unsupported resume/correction
  behavior.
- Broad UI redesign beyond consuming the agreed structured job state.

## Execution Rule

R1 and R2 may land in one main-based PR because they share the same plugin
authority/writable-state boundary and the user explicitly requested a
synchronized fix. Later runtime slices are serial. By default, production
edits start only after the previous slice has landed or has an explicit defer
decision recorded here. When the closure goal above is active, use its local
stack rule instead: the previous row must have a verified atomic commit before
the next local slice starts, but that commit is not yet a merge or release.
A defer or blocker does not unlock the next row. Every slice must:

1. Reproduce the failure or preserve the review counterexample as a test.
2. Freeze ownership and terminal-state semantics before implementation.
3. Update every affected authoritative contract in the same patch.
4. Pass focused tests after merging the latest `main` into the candidate.
5. Run source validation only through `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/ccb_test`
   from `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2` when runtime evidence is required.
6. Record the verified commit, verification, remaining risk, and next target
   before advancing the roadmap; merge and release remain separate gates.
