# Workflow RolePack External Spec Handoff V1

Date: 2026-06-27

## Goal

Move the CCB workflow role drafts from
`docs/plantree/plans/agentic-loop-workflow/drafts/agentroles.*` into the
external Agent Roles spec repository as installable catalog Roles, then verify
that CCB can consume them through the normal Role store, provider skill
projection, and artifact command surfaces.

## Scope

External target:

- `/home/bfly/yunwei/agent-roles-spec`

Roles:

- `agentroles.ccb_frontdesk`
- `agentroles.ccb_planner`
- `agentroles.ccb_clarification_broker`
- `agentroles.ccb_plan_reviewer`
- `agentroles.ccb_orchestrator`
- `agentroles.ccb_worker`
- `agentroles.ccb_checker`
- `agentroles.ccb_round_checker`

Core chain to prove:

```text
planner -> clarification_broker -> frontdesk -> plan_reviewer -> orchestrator
```

## Requirements

- Planner Role can be installed and carries task-packet, readiness, and
  candidate-question artifact templates.
- Clarification broker Role can be installed and carries candidate-question
  compression plus user-batch and normalized-answer templates.
- Plan reviewer Role can be installed and carries a review artifact contract.
- Orchestrator Role keeps runtime mutation behind `orchestrator-capacity`; it
  must not edit `.ccb/ccb.config`, runtime files, tmux state, or provider
  sessions directly.
- Every CCB workflow Role declares the full CCB provider set in
  `adapters/ccb/adapter.toml`, so CCB can project provider-local `ask` skills
  and role skills consistently.
- CCB source carries provider-local `ask` instructions for the declared
  provider set: Codex, Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, Kimi, Mimo, Qwen, Z.ai, and
  Droid. Native CLI providers may consume these as text assets until they gain
  richer skill-directory projection.
- Source-wrapper smoke must run from `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2`, not from
  the CCB source checkout.

## External Landing

Materialized in `/home/bfly/yunwei/agent-roles-spec`:

- catalog role directories under `roles/ccb-*`;
- aliases in `aliases.toml`;
- catalog discovery notes in `roles/README.md`;
- focused tests in `tests/test_ccb_workflow_roles.py`;
- existing `tests/test_ccb_orchestrator_role.py` updated for
  `round-aggregation`;
- existing `roles/code-reviewer` remains separate from `agentroles.ccb_checker`.

Important correction:

- `normalized-answers.jsonl` now uses `"source":"user"` instead of the invalid
  placeholder enum string `"user|default|deferred"`. The same fix was mirrored
  back into the CCB plan-tree draft templates.

## Verification

External Agent Roles spec tests:

```bash
cd /home/bfly/yunwei/agent-roles-spec
python -m pytest -q
```

Result:

```text
69 passed in 2.80s
```

CCB targeted tests after draft template correction:

```bash
cd /home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source
PYTHONPATH=lib pytest -q \
  test/test_ask_skill_templates.py \
  test/test_repo_hygiene.py \
  test/test_orchestrator_rolepack.py \
  test/test_question_cli.py \
  test/test_plan_tasks_cli.py
```

Result:

```text
37 passed in 0.50s
```

Source wrapper diagnose:

```bash
cd /home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2
HOME=/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/source_home \
CCB_SOURCE_HOME=/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/source_home \
/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/ccb_test --diagnose
```

Result:

```text
allowed_source_test_project: yes
```

Install/config/capacity smoke project:

```text
/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/workflow-rolepack-handoff-smoke
```

Evidence:

- `ccb_test roles install` installed all eight workflow Roles from
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/agent-roles-spec` into the smoke Role store.
- `ccb_test config validate` loaded the project config with
  `frontdesk`, `planner`, `clarification_broker`, `plan_reviewer`, and
  `orchestrator` as configured agents.
- `ccb_test loop capacity ensure --loop-id smoke --profile worker=1 --profile
  code_reviewer=1 --json` returned `loop_capacity_status: ensured` with
  `agentroles.ccb_worker` and `agentroles.ccb_checker`; apply was correctly
  `deferred_until_start` because the smoke project was unmounted.
- Direct Codex materialization proved `ask` plus role skills were projected
  for `frontdesk`, `planner`, `clarification_broker`, `plan_reviewer`, and
  `orchestrator`.
- Artifact smoke imported planner artifacts, candidate questions, frontdesk
  question batch, raw answer, normalized answers, review artifact, and then
  moved task `role-handoff-001` to `ready`.

## Completion Audit

- External Role source exists and is installable: proven by Agent Roles full
  test suite and `ccb_test roles install` smoke.
- Planner artifact path is usable: proven by planner templates imported through
  `ccb plan task-artifact` and `ccb question candidate-import`.
- Clarification broker path is usable: proven by `user-batch-import`,
  `answer-import`, and corrected `normalized-import`.
- Plan reviewer path is usable: proven by `review` artifact import and
  `task-status ready`.
- Orchestrator capacity boundary is preserved: proven by role tests and
  capacity smoke using `ccb loop capacity ensure/status`, not direct runtime
  edits.
- Provider/ask projection is covered: proven by adapter provider declarations
  and Codex materialization smoke checking both `skills/ask/SKILL.md` and
  each role skill. CCB source also now includes provider-local `ask` assets for
  Gemini, Qwen, and Z.ai in addition to the pre-existing Codex, Claude, Droid,
  Kimi, Mimo, and OpenCode assets, with template/hygiene tests covering the
  full set.
