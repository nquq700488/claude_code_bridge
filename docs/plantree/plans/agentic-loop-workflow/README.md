# Agentic Loop Workflow Plan

Date: 2026-06-24

## Purpose

Design a CCB-native multi-agent workflow loop that further reduces the burden
on the `frontdesk` group. In this model, `frontdesk` remains the user-facing boundary and
escalation surface, while planning, execution-document maintenance, task
decomposition, dynamic worker-team activation, loop monitoring, recovery, and
plan-tree synchronization are handled by separate roles under a scripted state
machine.

The basic design premise is to combine a simple, stable program kernel with
flexible agent intelligence. Scripts enforce hard constraints, identity,
state, locks, indexes, and commit rules. Agents provide semantic understanding,
planning, review, diagnosis, and human-readable documents.

The direction borrows Trellis' durable-state idea, where workflow truth lives
outside the model conversation and is advanced through scripts rather than
free-form memory. It also borrows the Team Builder idea from AutoGen Studio:
teams, roles, handoffs, and termination conditions should be declared as
workflow objects rather than improvised in every run.

CCB should not copy Trellis' implicit provider-native subagent model. Because
CCB already has visible agents, `ask`, callbacks, panes, runtime status, and
daemon-owned communication state, this plan favors explicit, inspectable,
recoverable workflow loops.

## Scope

In scope:

- A user-facing `frontdesk` group that only handles user discussion, macro-task
  intake, confirmations, final reporting, and unrecoverable escalation.
- A planner group that turns macro tasks into durable execution documents,
  including PRD-style requirements, design notes, acceptance criteria,
  risk notes, and task readiness state.
- A plan steward role that maintains long-term plan-tree state and short-term
  progress state, but does not perform product implementation.
- A deterministic loop runner that reads short-term workflow state and starts
  or advances execution loops without relying on one agent's conversation
  memory.
- An orchestrator role that decomposes a ready execution task into bounded
  work items, selects the required execution-node topology, constrains worker
  asks, and may request dynamic agent load/unload through script-owned runtime
  surfaces.
- A dynamic agent lifecycle layer where long-lived roles such as frontend,
  planner, and orchestrator default to hide/park, while short-lived execution
  roles can be unloaded after idle/evidence gates.
- Dynamic execution nodes, each defaulting to a flat `worker + checker`
  structure. More complex node-internal teams are deferred until the work item
  cannot be safely split by orchestrator.
- Checker as an independent quality gate that designs node-level verification,
  audits worker output against the original design, and rejects hidden
  fallback, degradation, scope shrinkage, or false success.
- Partial execution semantics where non-converged nodes freeze only their
  dependent branch while unrelated sibling work drains to completion.
- A round-level checker that verifies the whole loop round after node work is
  drained, using planner-defined verification contracts and the actual
  orchestrator dependency graph.
- An inner monitor layer that watches loop health, `ask`/callback status,
  node heartbeats, artifacts, timeouts, and communication anomalies.
- A clarification broker path that receives stage-level candidate questions
  from planner group, filters or defaults non-blocking items, and sends only
  curated user-facing question references to `frontdesk`.
- Scripted state transitions so agents can propose progress but CCB-owned
  commands write authority state.
- Script-owned plan packets and runtime lists: durable Markdown records live
  under plan-tree, while high-frequency loop state lives under `.ccb/runtime`
  and is updated only through CCB command surfaces.
- Context-purity boundaries that keep volatile execution detail out of `frontdesk`
  and out of long-term plan-tree files unless it becomes durable evidence,
  decision material, or a blocker.
- Team-spec style declarations for roles, handoffs, termination conditions,
  escalation conditions, and per-loop limits.
- Plan-tree synchronization only at durable boundaries such as accepted plans,
  decisions, evidence, blockers, and completion.

Out of scope:

- Making `frontdesk` a hidden central executor.
- Letting worker agents freely modify authoritative loop state without a
  scripted transition.
- Replacing ccbd, dispatcher, message bureau, or provider completion authority.
- Treating the inner monitor as a business-task decision maker.
- Keeping high-frequency loop events in committed plan-tree Markdown.
- Allowing unbounded agent chains, unbounded recovery loops, or unbounded
  dynamic node creation.
- Automatically publishing releases, deleting files, or performing destructive
  repair without the existing user-confirmation and release gates.
