# Agentic Loop Workflow Open Questions

Date: 2026-06-24

## Product Questions

1. Resolved V1 direction: the first user-visible automatic runner is
   `ccb loop runner --once`, which scans for one ready task, executes one round,
   imports the result, and exits. Long-running daemon or frontdesk-triggered
   automatic activation remains deferred.
2. Should a blank CCB project include this workflow by default, or should it be
   an optional advanced mode?
3. What is the smallest acceptable v1: planner group plus one execution node,
   or planner group plus orchestrator plus execution node?
4. Should users see loop state in the sidebar/rich panel in v1, or only through
   CLI diagnostics?

## State And Authority Questions

1. Resolved direction: loop runner owns role activation and stop decisions by
   reading task/loop state, while scripts write authoritative status. See
   [decisions/009-loop-runner-activates-planner-and-stops.md](decisions/009-loop-runner-activates-planner-and-stops.md).
2. Resolved V1 direction: task-level read-modify-write protection starts as a
   per-task lock in the `ccb plan` command service used by
   `task-bind-loop`/`task-import-round`. The longer-term owner for loop-wide
   locks across ccbd, an external runner, or a separate helper remains open.
3. Should plan steward be an agent-only role, a deterministic command surface,
   or both? Current V1 direction: deterministic `ccb plan` commands write
   authority; an optional semantic steward may audit and summarize but cannot
   bypass scripts.
4. Should agents be allowed to request transitions directly, or must every
   transition pass through an explicit `plan_steward` approval step?
5. What fields are required for a transition to be accepted: phase, owner,
   artifact refs, verification refs, parent job id, and lease id?
6. Resolved for V1: `ccb plan task-*` should be implemented as first-class CLI
   commands for task packet creation, artifact import, status, show/list, and
   breadcrumb. See
   [topics/plan-update-script-landing.md](topics/plan-update-script-landing.md).
7. Resolved next slice: round checker output is not enough by itself. The
   result must be imported through `task-import-round`, validated against the
   current loop binding, converted to a first-class round artifact, and only
   then used by loop runner for the next activation decision.
8. What stale-lease reset policy is safe enough for V1 after a runner crashes
   while a task is `running`?

## Planner Questions

1. Resolved design boundary: planner is inside the workflow loop but outside
   execution rounds. It is activated for `draft`, resolved clarification,
   `partial`, `replan_required`, resolved blockers, or changed user scope. See
   [topics/complete-workflow-design.md](topics/complete-workflow-design.md).
2. Should `agentroles.planner` be published as a standalone Agent Roles catalog
   role immediately, or should V1 keep planner as a project-local configured
   role until the `ccb plan` script surface lands?
3. Should `plan_reviewer` be a separate role id or a mode/profile of planner
   for V1?
4. Should `ready` require a semantic `review.md` artifact in every case, or
   can low-risk tasks be marked ready by deterministic required-field checks
   only?
5. What maximum size should a planner handoff have before broker/orchestrator
   must receive artifact links instead of inline content?
6. Resolved direction: planner cycling must have its own stop limits, including
   no new artifact/decision evidence, repeated same failure signature, repeated
   script validation failure, and excessive scope churn. See
   [topics/planner-role-design.md](topics/planner-role-design.md).

## Clarification Questions

1. Should the deterministic broker router live in the same helper as
   `ccb loop`, or as a separate `ccb question` command namespace?
2. What is the default per-phase user-question budget: one question, up to
   three questions, or configurable by workflow spec?
3. Should `frontdesk` be allowed to read only `user_questions.md` display
   artifacts, or may it inspect broker review metadata when the user asks why
   a question is being asked?
4. What confidence threshold should force a second clarification instead of
   letting broker normalize a vague user answer?

## Runtime Questions

1. When should the design graduate from fixed configured `coder`/`checker`
   agents to loop-runner-mediated dynamic execution-node load/unload?
2. How should temporary execution nodes be named and cleaned up without
   conflicting with configured long-lived agents?
3. What is the hard maximum for per-loop nodes, recovery rounds, and total
   runtime after default per-node rework is bounded separately?
4. Should the orchestrator be released and recreated after each loop round, or
   can it persist across multiple rounds with state rehydration?
5. Should the first `ccb loop capacity` implementation use daemon-side
   transient runtime overlays immediately, or start with a generated config
   block over the existing guarded `ccb reload` transaction?
6. What exact provider adapter mapping should compile
   `thinking = "low|medium|high"` into provider-specific startup arguments or
   model settings?
7. Should generated loop agents appear in the sidebar as normal agents, grouped
   under a loop window, or under a dedicated runtime section?

## Execution Verification Questions

1. Resolved for V1: round checker is a dedicated semantic role identity. It
   produces post-round evidence, while deterministic scripts write task status.
   See
   [decisions/008-round-checker-separate-planner-rehydrates.md](decisions/008-round-checker-separate-planner-rehydrates.md).
2. What exact schema should represent node status, branch status, and round
   status in `.ccb/runtime/loops/<loop-id>/`?
3. Should `max_node_rework_rounds = 2` and `max_same_failure_signature = 2`
   be global defaults or workflow-spec fields?
4. Which round-check commands should be deterministic shell/test invocations,
   and which may rely on semantic review?
5. Resolved direction: completed sibling work is preserved by importing compact
   partial evidence and letting planner rehydrate from task packet plus round
   evidence for the next loop. The exact branch schema remains open. See
   [topics/round-checker-and-planner-rehydration.md](topics/round-checker-and-planner-rehydration.md).
6. Resolved direction: `rework_node` is only for bounded fixes inside the
   current plan. If the split, dependency graph, acceptance criteria,
   verification contract, or risk model must change, orchestrator/round
   checker should escalate to `partial` or `replan_required`.
7. What exact schema should represent round result imports:
   `round_pass`, `round_partial`, `round_replan`, and `round_blocker`?

## Monitoring Questions

1. Which health checks belong to deterministic monitor code versus semantic
   monitor agents?
2. When `ask` or callback state disagrees with pane/provider evidence, which
   state is authoritative for loop escalation?
3. What evidence package should the inner monitor send to `frontdesk` when it cannot
   recover?
4. How should monitor alerts avoid becoming noisy during normal long-running
   provider work?

## Plan-Tree Questions

1. Which loop milestones must sync to `docs/plantree`: accepted plan, ready
   execution task, blocker, completed evidence, or every phase transition?
2. Should durable task packets keep all completed tasks indefinitely under
   `tasks/`, or should old task packets be archived into `history/` after a
   retention threshold?
3. How should a loop produce durable history without turning plan-tree files
   into event logs?
4. For `ccb plan` V1, should `tasks/index.json` be committed durable state or
   treated as generated/machine-owned state that can be rebuilt from task
   directories?
5. Should task ids be time-based, slug-based, or content-hash-assisted to
   balance human readability with collision safety?
