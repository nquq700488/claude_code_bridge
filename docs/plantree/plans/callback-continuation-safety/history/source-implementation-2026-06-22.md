# Source Implementation Checkpoint

Date: 2026-06-22

## Summary

Implemented the callback-continuation safety slice in the working tree. The
change blocks the observed second-edge loop where a continuation receiver uses
`ask --callback` to send the final result back to the continuation's original
caller.

## Landed Surface

- Runtime guard in `lib/ccbd/services/dispatcher_runtime/callbacks.py`.
- Continuation prompt wording in the same module.
- Inherited ask skill templates for Codex, Claude, Droid, Kimi, MiMo, and
  OpenCode.
- Runtime project memory coordination wording.
- Callback docs and manuals.
- Dispatcher integration tests, ask skill template tests, and project memory
  tests.

## Verification

Targeted and related tests passed:

```text
8 passed
175 passed
```

Full pytest results:

```text
2954 passed, 2 skipped
2953 passed, 2 skipped, 1 failed
```

The second full run's single failure was
`test_ccb_start_loads_claude_binding_from_project_anchor`, which failed with
`ccbd is unavailable: lifecycle_starting(stage=spawn_requested)`. The same test
passed when rerun by itself:

```text
1 passed
```

Source wrapper validation from `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2`:

```text
ccb_test --diagnose: allowed source-test project
ccb_test doctor: completed, but current test project ccbd is stale/degraded
```

## Residual Risk

Live mixed-provider provider-pane validation was not completed in this
checkpoint because the existing external source-test project has stale/degraded
ccbd state. The dispatcher-level tests cover the callback semantics directly,
including the Claude-triggered bad edge pattern.
