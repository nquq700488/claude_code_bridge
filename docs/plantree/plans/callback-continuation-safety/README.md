# Callback Continuation Safety Plan

Date: 2026-06-22

## Purpose

Prevent callback continuation jobs from being mistaken for new upstream
delegation work. The immediate failure mode is a mixed-provider chain where
Claude receives a callback continuation and sends `ask --callback` back to the
original caller instead of finishing the current turn so CCB can auto-propagate
the result.

## Current Incident Summary

The observed chain was:

```text
bugb -> coworker -> archi -> coworker continuation
```

The `archi -> coworker` continuation was correct. The failure started when
`coworker` treated the continuation instruction as a new CCB send and issued a
new `ask --callback` to `bugb`. That created a second callback edge and allowed
the participants to keep replying through fresh callback work instead of
settling the original edge.

Codex-only chains are less likely to hit this because Codex is handled as a
more tightly bound protocol turn. Claude runs as an interactive Claude Code pane
with projected ask guidance and command access, so ambiguous "reply to original
caller" language is more likely to become an actual `ask` command.

## Recommended Direction

Use runtime authority first, then prompt and skill hardening:

1. Add a `ccbd` guard that rejects `ask --callback` from a
   `callback_continuation` job when the target is the original caller or
   upstream caller for that continuation.
2. Rewrite callback continuation text so it says to finish the current turn and
   not call `ask`, `--callback`, or `--silence` to the original caller.
3. Add provider-neutral ask skill guidance for callback continuation finalizing,
   with Claude-specific validation because Claude is the easiest provider to
   trigger the loop.
4. Add mixed-provider regression coverage that proves the bad second edge is
   rejected while normal callback chaining still works.

## Authority

Product/runtime contracts under `docs/` still own shipped behavior. This plan
records the targeted safety change and readiness path.

## Scope

In scope:

- Callback continuation validation in `ccbd`.
- Callback continuation body text.
- Inherited ask skill wording for continuation finalization.
- Mixed Codex/Claude callback-chain tests and source-under-test validation.
- Diagnostics that make bad second-edge attempts easy to identify.

Out of scope:

- Transport-level FIFO, ACK, large-payload spool, or cancel visibility work.
- Provider session isolation or startup supervision.
- General ask parameter policy unrelated to callback continuation finalization.
- Changing the public semantics that each waiting hop in a normal callback
  chain uses `--callback`.
