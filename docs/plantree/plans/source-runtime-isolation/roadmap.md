# Source Runtime Isolation Roadmap

Date: 2026-06-09

## Done

- `ccb` has a source-checkout guard that refuses stateful commands outside
  allowed external test roots while still allowing safe introspection.
- `ccb_test` wraps the source checkout and refuses to run from
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source` or against a project inside the source
  checkout.
- `test/test_source_runtime_guard.py` covers the source entrypoint guard,
  `ccb_test` external-project behavior, and source-checkout rejection.
- Project memory now states that source validation must use `ccb_test` from an
  external project and must not install source changes into the global/system
  environment.
- Default source-test roots are narrowed to `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2` for
  both `ccb` and `ccb_test`; legacy sibling directories require explicit
  `CCB_SOURCE_ALLOWED_ROOTS` or `CCB_TEST_ROOTS` overrides.
- `ccb_test` preflight now rejects arbitrary external CWD and `--project`
  targets unless they are under an allowed source-test root.
- `ccb_test --diagnose` reports the running wrapper, source `ccb`, CWD,
  project paths, default roots, explicit env roots, effective roots, checked
  paths, and whether the current invocation is allowed as a source-test
  project.

## In Progress

- Make the operational workflow explicit in project memory, baseline gates,
  and active runbooks so agents stop treating source validation as a normal
  `ccb` command.
- Record cleanup rules for project-agent runtime state so active installed
  work-environment state is not deleted during source testing.

## Next

1. Add a test or hygiene check that active runbooks use the absolute source
   wrapper when validating current source changes.
2. Audit global wrapper targets such as `~/.local/bin/ccb` and `PATH` order
   before declaring the installed work environment stable.
3. Define an explicit test-project reset procedure for
   `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2` that stops its backend before removing
   disposable runtime residue.

## Deferred

- Automatic migration or deletion of old ad hoc test directories under
  `/home/bfly/yunwei`.
- Automatically repairing user shell startup files or global PATH order.
- Removing diagnostic overrides such as `CCB_SOURCE_RUNTIME_OK=1`.
