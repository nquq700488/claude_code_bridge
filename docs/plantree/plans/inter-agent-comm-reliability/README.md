# Inter-Agent Communication Reliability

Date: 2026-06-14

Last updated: 2026-09-21

## Current Input-Guard Slice

The owner requested a local v8.7.0 source commit and bilingual README coverage
on 2026-09-21. Preparation is isolated on `release/v8.7.0`; no public publication
or shared-runtime promotion is included. Existing technical readiness findings
below remain open and are disclosed in the release notes.

See [v8.7.0 local validation](evidence/release-870-validation-20260921.md)
for the full-suite failure audit, successful reruns and packaging checks.

Mode: `ready-check` / local source preparation. The v8.7.0 source contains a guard candidate and
reported isolated/installed evidence, but this plan does not treat either as a
release or enablement approval. The required corrections are in the
[input-draft guard topic](topics/input-draft-delivery-guard.md).

- [Reported installed real-project qualification](evidence/installed-draft-guard-20260920.md):
  real Codex/OMP/Claude jobs, FIFO, modal exit, narrow-window and human-turn
  checks; fixed historical-text/draft keyword false vetoes and Claude busy
  detection. Final keyword-containing 180-second runs pass on all three;
  469 regressions pass. Codex remote-session failure after daemon
  termination requires explicit recovery; this is not an automatic-recovery pass.

- [Candidate implementation and experiments](evidence/input-draft-guard-v1-20260920.md):
  Codex, Claude and OMP guarded tmux paths implemented in the working tree;
  456 related tests pass. All three passed real 180-second draft wait/clear/send
  experiments in disposable native CLIs. No live install, commit or release.

- [Deep Codex/Claude composer probe](evidence/codex-claude-composer-deep-probe-20260920.md):
  24 idle clear/readback cases passed; Claude real-UI suggestions distinguished
  from accepted drafts in three themes using local mock responses. Owner excludes
  the literal Codex-placeholder collision. Integrated scope is documented below.
- [Initial composer probe](evidence/composer-native-probe-20260920.md): OMP native
  multiline read/clear confirmed; earlier Codex/Claude observations are superseded
  by the deep probe within its explicitly tested scope.

- [Input draft delivery guard](topics/input-draft-delivery-guard.md): retains
  FIFO/turn-end gates, pre-claim fixed 180-second wait and final sender checks
  for all three providers in the candidate. Codex now has a deferred unsent path;
  Claude/OMP reuse theirs. However Codex/Claude deadline clearing is still `Ctrl-C`,
  and generic `draft_guard_send_unknown` terminalization expands provider semantics.
  Neither is approved for enablement. OMP requires the new extension and default
  Status Band layout. Unsupported transports/old OMP mounts remain unprotected;
  unknown observations on enabled paths hold the head.

Owner-approved direction under implementation and review:
ordinary ask requests and back results share one chronological FIFO per
target Agent through the exact processing-turn end; empty results generate a
caller inspection notice instead of automatic empty-result retries or
reactivation. The no-evidence watchdog identified by independent review was
removed on 2026-09-19; deliveries reuse existing provider turn completion,
and the dispatcher polling gate now shares one turn-end rule set for asks
and deliveries (job-record delivery identity, no per-provider fork).
Real Codex/OMP FIFO qualification passed using an isolated installed snapshot;
Codex empty notice passed, OMP empty-terminal and Claude qualification remain
open (see roadmap).

- [Independent review](evidence/agent1-independent-review-20260919.md):
  402 existing tests pass; an independent exclusivity probe reproduces the
  original watchdog overlap defect.
- [Turn-end-only fix](evidence/provider-turn-end-only-20260919.md): watchdog
  removed; elapsed time cannot advance the queue; 402 tests pass.
- [Shared ask/back turn-end gate](evidence/ask-back-shared-turn-end-gate-20260919.md):
  dispatcher delivery fork removed; job-record delivery identity with legacy
  flag as compat fallback; 406 tests pass.
- [Installed Codex/OMP qualification](evidence/installed-codex-omp-qualification-20260919.md):
  real A→X→B ordering passed in both directions; Codex empty notice passed;
  OMP native empty continuation did not emit a final settled event.
- [Screen and abnormal reply guidance](evidence/screen-caller-inspection-20260919.md):
  read-only `ccb screen <agent>` and caller-owned abnormal-result inspection
  landed in source; real Codex/OMP pane capture verified without daemon restart.
- [v8.6.19 release validation](evidence/release-8619-validation-20260919.md):
  source commits, full-suite failure audit, corrected rerun and package gates.

- [Unified FIFO design](topics/unified-message-fifo.md): ordering, execution
  ownership, recovery, implementation slices, acceptance tests, and the Q1
  audit answers.
- [Empty-result notice design](topics/empty-result-caller-notice.md): minimal
  classification, caller guidance, retry removal, compatibility gates, and
  the Q1 audit answers.

These topics define the intended contract; recorded implementation evidence
does not yet establish full acceptance. Earlier transport analysis below
remains historical context.

## Purpose

Track CCB inter-agent message transport reliability proposals and source
slices before they are allowed into the release path.

This plan currently records analysis of PR226-style changes:

- persistent Codex FIFO reader
- bounded non-blocking FIFO writes
- read ACK files
- large payload spool pointers
- cancel flag visibility
- communication-path logging

## Current Decision

The first small hard-gate source slice and the Codex no-progress delivery
timeout slice have been implemented in the working tree after coworker review.
They are intentionally narrower than PR238/PR239: keep provider-turn ownership
as the root fix, do not merge broad degraded-timeout policy, and do not
introduce a persistent tailer until benchmark evidence requires it.

The useful direction is accepted for further study on Linux, macOS, and WSL,
but adoption requires a tighter reliability boundary and regression coverage.
Native Windows support is explicitly out of scope for this plan slice.

## Authority

Runtime contracts still live in the product documents under `docs/`.
This plan root records candidate transport changes, risks, and readiness gates;
it does not override shipped behavior.

## Scope

In scope:

- Linux, macOS, and WSL CCB inter-agent communication reliability.
- Codex bridge FIFO lifecycle and send-path behavior.
- ACK semantics, large request transport, marker uniqueness, and failure
  diagnosability.
- Cancel visibility at the CCB-to-agent prompt boundary.

Out of scope for this slice:

- Native Windows transport, startup, health, or mux behavior.
- Provider-specific completion terminalization remains in
  [../managed-provider-completion-reliability/README.md](../managed-provider-completion-reliability/README.md).
  This slice consumes its evidence and changes empty-result handling after a
  terminal decision; it does not weaken request/session/turn attribution.
- Immediate source implementation or release promotion.
