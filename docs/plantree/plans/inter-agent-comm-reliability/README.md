# Inter-Agent Communication Reliability

Date: 2026-06-14

Last updated: 2026-07-07

## Purpose

Track CCB inter-agent message transport reliability proposals and source
slices before they are allowed into the release path.

This plan currently records analysis of PR226-style changes:

- persistent Codex FIFO reader
- bounded non-blocking FIFO writes
- read ACK files
- large payload spool pointers
- cancel flag visibility
- communication-path logging

## Current Decision

The first small hard-gate source slice and the Codex no-progress delivery
timeout slice have been implemented in the working tree after coworker review.
They are intentionally narrower than PR238/PR239: keep provider-turn ownership
as the root fix, do not merge broad degraded-timeout policy, and do not
introduce a persistent tailer until benchmark evidence requires it.

The useful direction is accepted for further study on Linux, macOS, and WSL,
but adoption requires a tighter reliability boundary and regression coverage.
Native Windows support is explicitly out of scope for this plan slice.

## Authority

Runtime contracts still live in the product documents under `docs/`.
This plan root records candidate transport changes, risks, and readiness gates;
it does not override shipped behavior.

## Scope

In scope:

- Linux, macOS, and WSL CCB inter-agent communication reliability.
- Codex bridge FIFO lifecycle and send-path behavior.
- ACK semantics, large request transport, marker uniqueness, and failure
  diagnosability.
- Cancel visibility at the CCB-to-agent prompt boundary.

Out of scope for this slice:

- Native Windows transport, startup, health, or mux behavior.
- Provider completion terminalization; that remains in
  [../managed-provider-completion-reliability/README.md](../managed-provider-completion-reliability/README.md).
- Immediate source implementation or release promotion.
