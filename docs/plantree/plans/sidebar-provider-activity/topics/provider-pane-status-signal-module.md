# Provider Pane Status Signal Module

Date: 2026-06-29
Role: Landing plan
Status: PR1 landed; Codex ProjectView/sidebar slice landed
Read when: Extracting pane-text provider status parsing from the Codex probe
into production code, or adding Claude pane parsing later.

## Goal

Create a small provider pane-status signal module that exposes explicit,
provider-specific pane observations without turning them into job lifecycle
authority.

The module should make status parsing reusable by:

- the standalone Codex pane probe;
- `ccbd.project_view` activity/status rendering;
- future Claude and other CLI provider pane parsers.

The design principle is strict:

```text
unknown stays unknown
source failure stays visible
pane observation never completes a CCB job by itself
```

## Package Boundary

Use a provider-pane-specific package name:

```text
lib/provider_pane_status/
  __init__.py
  models.py
  codex_pane.py
  codex_session.py
```

Initial landing includes `models.py`, `codex_pane.py`, and the Codex-specific
`codex_session.py` supplement. Keep future Claude/Gemini session supplements
provider-specific until a second implementation proves shared code is useful.

Do not add these in the first landing:

- `resolver.py`
- `project_view_adapter.py`
- generic `AgentRuntimeStatus` publisher logic
- smoothing / hysteresis cache
- tmux capture or pipe-pane acquisition code
- control-plane completion code

Rationale:

- `provider_pane_status` names the source and prevents confusion with runtime
  or job authority.
- `models.py` gives Claude a stable future contract without forcing a generic
  resolver before a second provider exists.
- `codex_pane.py` keeps the first production parser focused and testable.

## Signal Model

The first model should represent pane observations, not lifecycle decisions.
Keep `models.py` deliberately small in v1.

Initial runtime model set:

- `ProviderPaneStatusSignal`
- `PaneCompletionEvidence`

Do not add independent `PaneSourceStatus` or `PaneParsedState` enum classes in
the first landing. Use `source_status: Literal["ok", "error"]` or equivalent
constants, and keep `parsed_state` as a string plus provider-local
`STATUS_CATALOG`. If Claude later proves that a shared enum removes real
duplication, introduce it then.

`PaneCompletionEvidence` replaces wording such as `terminal_outcome` in shared
production models. It means "visible pane evidence only". It must not be used
to call `dispatcher.complete()` or mutate a job status.

The `PaneCompletionEvidence` dataclass must carry this warning in its runtime
docstring:

```text
Pane completion evidence is observation only, not job lifecycle authority.
Passing it to dispatcher.complete() or using it to build a CompletionDecision
directly is a bug.
```

Add a marker method such as `__not_a_job_terminator__()` so tests can identify
the type and keep it out of dispatcher/completion authority paths.

Minimum fields:

```text
ProviderPaneStatusSignal
  provider
  source_status: ok | error
  parsed_state: string
  reason
  matched_patterns
  notes
  completion_evidence
```

Important split:

- `source_status=error` means capture/acquisition failed, for example tmux
  failed, timed out, or the pane id was invalid.
- `parsed_state=unknown` means capture succeeded but the parser found no known
  explicit provider state.

The parser should only classify text. It should not manufacture source errors.

## Codex Parser Rules

Move the current strict parser from
`scripts/probe_codex_pane_status.py` into `codex_pane.py`.

Carry forward the current hard rules:

- active states require Codex status-line-shaped rows;
- conversation body text and indented examples are not authority;
- `Reconnecting...` is a recoverable active state and wins over nearby
  stream-disconnect text;
- retry counts and visible UI seconds are not lifecycle timing signals;
- `Worked for ...` is sufficient pane completion evidence, but still only
  observation;
- prompt visibility, pane quiet, output freshness, and job-running metadata do
  not imply `idle`, `working`, or `completed`;
- `Conversation interrupted` is historical pane text unless paired with a
  current hard marker.

Tighten during extraction rather than preserving known weak signals:

- waiting/user-input detection must be shape-aware enough to avoid generic
  body-text keyword matches;
- priority should be expressed as a visible table or ordered matcher list, not
  hidden as a long informal `if` chain;
- the probe script must not retain duplicate regex or parser constants after
  importing the shared module.

## ProjectView Integration

First ProjectView use should be direct and visible:

- `activity.py` calls the Codex pane parser for Codex panes.
- Codex-specific keyword scans in `_provider_working` and
  `_provider_terminal_error` are deleted instead of migrated.
- `provider_prompt_idle_after_request` and `provider_prompt_input_stuck` are
  deleted with their activity-status call paths. Prompt visibility is not a
  status or recovery authority.

Do not create a compatibility adapter in the first landing. If legacy
`activity_state` needs to remain present, map explicitly at the call site so
that `unknown` cannot be hidden behind a wrapper.

Required display behavior:

```text
job_status=running + pane parsed_state=unknown
  => expose both facts, do not synthesize working
```

If ProjectView needs a legacy single-field value before structured
`runtime_status` lands, unknown must map to an explicit unknown/pending reason,
not to idle, working, completed, or failed.

## Completion Boundary

Pane evidence is not job terminal authority.

Strong job lifecycle authority remains:

- `CompletionDecision`;
- provider protocol/session terminal events;
- hook artifacts when a provider contract declares them authoritative;
- reliability timeout terminalization, which should produce `incomplete`, not
  `completed`.

Pane completion evidence is useful for status display and diagnostics. It must
not bypass the existing completion pipeline.

## Fallback Decision

- failure handled: unknown text, ambiguous text, capture/acquisition failure,
  unsupported provider, missing completion evidence.
- continue or fail: continue rendering status, but surface `unknown` or
  `source_status=error`; do not substitute idle, working, completed, or failed.
- surfacing: status records carry `reason`, `source_status`, and matched
  evidence; capture failure is distinct from parse unknown.
- test: unknown mapping tests, capture-error tests, and ProjectView integration
  tests must prevent hidden fallback behavior.
- review needed: any future smoothing, stale-state reuse, or compatibility
  adapter must be separately reviewed because it can hide unknown evidence.

## Large File Decision

- file: `scripts/probe_codex_pane_status.py`
- signal: about 1000 lines mixing parser, tmux runner, prompt stimulus,
  timing, metrics, artifacts, and CLI.
- decision: extract the pure parser to `provider_pane_status.codex_pane`.
- rationale: extraction removes duplicated future parser logic while keeping
  runner behavior local to the demo script.
- verification: parser fixtures pass unchanged; script smoke output remains
  schema-compatible.

- file: `lib/ccbd/project_view/activity.py`
- signal: lifecycle guards, job/callback facts, pane heuristics, and provider
  text parsing share one module.
- decision: remove Codex-specific text heuristics from this file and call the
  shared parser directly. Do not grow a generic resolver here.
- rationale: provider parsing should be isolated; ProjectView should compose
  already-classified evidence.
- verification: ProjectView tests prove `unknown` is visible and not converted
  into a stronger state.

## Landing Sequence

PR1:

1. Add `lib/provider_pane_status/models.py` and
   `lib/provider_pane_status/codex_pane.py`.
2. Move the existing Codex parser fixtures under the new module tests and keep
   the current 28 behavior checks passing.
3. Update `scripts/probe_codex_pane_status.py` to import the shared parser;
   remove local parser constants and regex duplicates.
4. Add a smoke check proving probe artifact schema compatibility.

PR1 landed on 2026-06-29 with:

- `lib/provider_pane_status/models.py`
- `lib/provider_pane_status/codex_pane.py`
- `lib/provider_pane_status/codex_session.py`
- `test/test_provider_pane_status_codex.py`
- `test/test_provider_pane_status_codex_session.py`
- `scripts/probe_codex_pane_status.py` importing the shared parser and no
  longer retaining local `STATUS_MARKER_RE` or `CODEX_*_RE` duplicates.

Verification:

- `python -m py_compile scripts/probe_codex_pane_status.py
  lib/provider_pane_status/__init__.py lib/provider_pane_status/models.py
  lib/provider_pane_status/codex_pane.py
  lib/provider_pane_status/codex_session.py`
- `python -m pytest -q test/test_provider_pane_status_codex.py
  test/test_provider_pane_status_codex_session.py
  test/test_codex_pane_status_probe.py` -> `49 passed`
- Live test-home run:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T133020Z-2455185/artifacts/run.json`
  observed `unknown -> working -> unknown`, capture p95 1.6 ms, zero 1 s
  flicker transitions, and no completion without `Worked for ...`.
- Live isolated no-login run:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T133248Z-2540939/artifacts/run.json`
  observed `unknown -> auth_required`, capture p95 1.5 ms, zero flicker
  transitions.
- Live bad-config startup run:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T133335Z-2576972/artifacts/run.json`
  observed `unknown -> pane_dead`; its normalized pipe log contains explicit
  `Error loading config.toml`, but the pane/server exited before `capture-pane`
  could read that text. PR1 intentionally did not add raw-log backfill or
  source fallback; this is a source-acquisition design question for PR2.
- Live session-supplement run:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T141909Z-4154029/artifacts/run.json`
  observed runtime `unknown -> working -> free` while pane-only evidence stayed
  `unknown -> working -> unknown`. The `free` transition came from
  `codex_session_task_complete`, and turn timing terminalized as
  `terminal_state=free`, `terminal_outcome=completed`.
- Live boundary runs:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T142008Z-4183944/artifacts/run.json`
  stayed `pane_dead` despite an empty session root, and
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T142024Z-4191985/artifacts/run.json`
  stayed `waiting_for_user` for an untrusted new workdir. These prove
  session-derived `free` is not a fallback over explicit pane states.
- Stabilization evidence:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T143303Z-455718/artifacts/run.json`
  kept startup display at `unknown -> working -> free` instead of allowing old
  session `free` to jump ahead of pane boot work, and
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T143329Z-468685/artifacts/run.json`
  held `working` over the raw `codex_session_task_complete` transition for the
  bounded active-hold window before switching to `free`.
- Post-review cleanup: coworker review `job_2578d60d2d46` timed out with no
  actionable findings, so the local cleanup removed runtime `completed` from
  the display catalog, blocked prompt submission while a pane is already
  active, and made `empty_capture` reuse explicitly bounded by its own start
  time instead of by a refreshed stable-state timestamp.
- Compact follow-up review `job_c54b68ed7ac2` returned upstream 429 after
  retries were exhausted, so it did not provide a code-review signal. Treat
  the current state as locally verified, not coworker-approved.
- User decision on 2026-06-29: stop waiting for coworker review on this slice.
  Acceptance for the pane/session status probe is local tests plus live
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2` pressure evidence.
- Post-cleanup pressure evidence:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T144549Z-901054/artifacts/run.json`
  exposed new-workdir `waiting_for_user` immediately with zero flicker;
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T144608Z-910979/artifacts/run.json`
  and
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T144656Z-947753/artifacts/run.json`
  both stayed `unknown -> working -> free` with zero flicker; high-frequency
  sampling in
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T144755Z-990498/artifacts/run.json`
  reached 9.65 samples/s, 242 captures, p95 capture 1.7 ms, and zero flicker;
  isolated no-login
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T144836Z-1012045/artifacts/run.json`
  exposed `auth_required` immediately with zero flicker.
- Start-state decision: after prompt submission, raw `unknown` before the first
  explicit pane/session signal displays as runtime `start`, not `free` and not
  real `working`. Raw runtime remains recorded separately.
- Final no-review smoke:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe/run-20260629T152132Z-2210496/artifacts/run.json`
  stayed `start -> working -> free`, while raw runtime stayed
  `unknown -> working -> free`; it ended with runtime `free` from
  `codex_session_task_complete`, had zero flicker transitions, and measured
  p95 capture latency at 1.8 ms.

Stabilization is intentionally separate from parsing:

- pane parser output remains strict and raw;
- session output remains explicit and raw;
- `runtime_status` is the only state that applies bounded time extension;
- snapshots and metrics retain raw runtime, pane, and session streams for
  diagnostics.

Codex ProjectView/sidebar slice landed on 2026-06-29 with:

- `ccbd.project_view.service` now captures Codex pane text for ProjectView,
  composes shared pane parser output with the bounded managed-session
  supplement, and publishes `provider_runtime_status` on the agent row.
- `ccbd.project_view.activity` now lets Codex runtime status drive the sidebar
  presentation through explicit `activity_symbol` and `activity_color` values:
  `start` -> `◌` yellow, `working` -> `●` green, `tool_running` -> `◆` green,
  `reconnecting` -> `↻` yellow, `free` -> `◇` blue, known failures -> `✕` red,
  and `unknown` -> `?` gray.
- Legacy pane keyword/prompt/error heuristics are disabled for Codex rows. The
  generic helpers remain in place only for non-Codex providers until Claude has
  its own strict parser.
- Codex prompt-visible recovery hints are disabled. A running Codex job with raw
  runtime `unknown` now displays as runtime `start`; it does not become
  `provider_prompt_idle`, `provider_prompt_input_stuck`, or a recoverable
  prompt-stuck comm from the old logic.
- `unknown` remains visible as `provider_runtime_status.state=unknown`; it is
  not converted to idle, working, completed, or failed.
- On 2026-06-30 the old CCB Codex activity hook path was disabled for Codex:
  managed Codex homes no longer install `ccb-provider-activity-hook`, the hook
  script no-ops for `--provider codex`, and ProjectView ignores any stale
  `codex_hook` activity artifact for Codex rows. The generic hook framework is
  retained for non-Codex providers.

Verification:

- `python -m py_compile lib/ccbd/project_view/activity.py
  lib/ccbd/project_view/service.py`
- `python -m pytest -q test/test_ccbd_project_view.py` -> `71 passed`

Defer generic resolver or adapter work until at least one of these exists:

- a Claude pane parser;
- a second ProjectView/mobile consumer with the same mapping need;
- a structured `runtime_status` record ready to publish.

## Required Tests

Parser tests:

- current Codex working/status-line fixtures;
- hollow bullet `Booting MCP server` active row;
- conversation-body and indented status-shaped text stays unknown;
- reconnect wins over nearby stream-disconnect error text;
- auth-required, auth-failed, API error, config error, waiting, pane dead;
- `Worked for ...` completion evidence;
- `unknown after active` does not complete.

ProjectView tests:

- Codex conversation body containing `Working (...)`, API key text, or error
  examples does not become working/auth/error;
- unsupported provider with pane text returns unknown/no-provider-signal, not
  generic keyword status;
- job running plus Codex pane unknown displays runtime `start`, not working;
- capture/source error is visible and does not mutate job lifecycle;
- old prompt-idle/input-stuck functions cannot keep affecting Codex activity or
  Codex comm recoverability.

Hard deletion and authority tests:

- after Claude has its own parser, `activity.py` should no longer need to expose
  `_provider_working`;
- after Claude has its own parser, `activity.py` should no longer need to expose
  `provider_prompt_idle_after_request`;
- after Claude has its own parser, `activity.py` should no longer need to expose
  `provider_prompt_input_stuck`;
- unknown mapping is one-way: unknown pane input must not map to idle,
  working, completed, or failed;
- `PaneCompletionEvidence` must not appear in dispatcher completion paths or be
  passed to `dispatcher.complete()`;
- after PR1, `scripts/probe_codex_pane_status.py` must import parser constants
  and must not retain local `STATUS_MARKER_RE` or `CODEX_*_RE` duplicates.

Fixture tests:

- use one or two sanitized screen tails from
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-pane-status-probe` to tie real artifacts
  to parser fixtures.
- store sanitized committed fixtures under `test/fixtures/codex_pane/`, not as
  large inline strings in test code.

## Future Claude Path

When Claude pane status is added, extend the same package:

```text
lib/provider_pane_status/claude_pane.py
```

Claude must follow the same evidence discipline:

- provider-specific parser;
- explicit status shapes only;
- no prompt-visible idle authority;
- no quiet-output completion;
- pane evidence remains separate from hook/session completion authority.

Only after Codex and Claude both use the package should a resolver be
considered. At that point the resolver should compose typed signals; it should
not re-parse provider text or introduce fallback states.
