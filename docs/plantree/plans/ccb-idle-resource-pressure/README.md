# CCB Idle Resource Pressure Plan

Date: 2026-06-23

## Purpose

Design a low-risk path to reduce CCB's idle SSD writes, memory pressure, and
background CPU when many provider-backed agents stay mounted but are not
actively doing work.

## Problem Statement

The current runtime model keeps project daemons, provider bridges, tmux panes,
and provider CLI processes alive for fast interaction. That works for small
projects, but high-intensity multi-project usage causes idle resource pressure:

- `ccbd/main.py` and `keeper_main.py` continue to write heartbeat and runtime
  state while the project is idle.
- Each mounted provider can retain a full CLI process, bridge process, terminal
  pane, provider home, SQLite state, and session files.
- Runtime records such as `lease.json`, `keeper.json`, `lifecycle.json`,
  `runtime.json`, and `helper.json` can be rewritten even when the user sees no
  meaningful state change.
- Provider-local durable state, especially Codex session JSONL and SQLite WALs,
  can grow independently from CCB's own runtime metadata.

This plan focuses on idle behavior. Active task throughput and response
latency remain important, but idle safety should not require users to kill every
project manually.

## Goals

- Reduce repeated idle writes to `.ccb/ccbd/*` and `.ccb/agents/*/*.json`.
- Reduce memory and CPU from providers that are mounted but unused.
- Preserve fast wake-up for the first new ask or UI action after an idle period.
- Preserve ask correctness and callback stability: submit, queueing, callback
  continuation, reply delivery, cancellation, and resubmit semantics must remain
  authoritative while any idle policy is active.
- Keep durable state boundaries explicit: recoverable runtime residue should be
  movable to tmpfs or removable; user/session/auth state must remain safe.
- Provide observable counters so regressions are visible.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing provider CLIs or changing their internal storage format.
- Removing persistent provider sessions by default.
- Full Python control-plane rewrite.
- Making all runtime state in-memory only.
- Trading ask correctness for lower idle resource usage.

## Current Evidence

Local diagnosis on 2026-06-23 found:

- Codex `logs_2.sqlite` write pressure was real. The `v7.6.14` trigger-only
  mitigation was insufficient because it still kept the database on durable
  storage and only filtered selected levels; the source hardening now redirects
  the managed DB to a temp path and blocks diagnostic inserts by default.
- A 10-second `/proc/<pid>/io` sample showed several project `ccbd/main.py`
  processes writing hundreds of KB to a few MB per 10 seconds while idle.
- `state_5.sqlite*` was not a release blocker in the local release sample:
  small aggregate size and no 15-second idle mtime/size movement were observed.
- Recently touched files during idle were dominated by:
  - `.ccb/ccbd/lease.json`
  - `.ccb/ccbd/keeper.json`
  - `.ccb/ccbd/lifecycle.json`
  - `.ccb/agents/<agent>/runtime.json`
  - `.ccb/agents/<agent>/helper.json`
  - provider-side `state_5.sqlite-wal`, `sessions/*.jsonl`,
    `activity.json`, and `models_cache.json`
- Large disk usage came from per-agent `provider-state/codex/home` and shared
  plugin bundles; not all of that is continuous write pressure.

## Status

Planning. Corrected Codex diagnostic SQLite hardening is implemented in the
working tree after the partial `v7.6.14` mitigation; broader idle CPU, memory,
JSON write, heartbeat, and provider suspend work remains in planning.
