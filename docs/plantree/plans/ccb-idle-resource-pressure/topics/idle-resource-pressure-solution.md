# Idle Resource Pressure Solution

Date: 2026-06-23

## Design Principles

- Treat idle pressure as a lifecycle problem, not a single log-file problem.
- Prefer no-op suppression before adding new state machines.
- Keep durable authority on disk; move only rebuildable runtime residue to
  tmpfs.
- Do not hide state from operators: replace noisy writes with metrics and
  explicit idle/suspended states.
- Make all aggressive behavior opt-in before changing defaults.
- Treat ask stability as non-negotiable: resource savings must not change
  submit, queue, callback continuation, reply delivery, cancel, or resubmit
  semantics.

## Ask Stability Contract

Any idle resource policy must preserve these behaviors:

- Socket request handling stays hot. A project may reduce maintenance work while
  idle, but the `ccbd` socket server must keep accepting submit/get/ps/cancel
  requests without waiting for the next idle heartbeat interval.
- Ask submission is an activity edge. Any accepted submit, resubmit, callback
  continuation, reply delivery, cancel, or repair request immediately exits
  deep idle and schedules an active maintenance pass.
- Queue order remains authoritative. No idle policy may reorder accepted jobs,
  skip queued jobs, or infer provider idleness from an empty pane while the
  dispatcher has outstanding work for that target.
- Callback edges are active work. A pending callback edge, child-completed edge
  awaiting continuation submission, or continuation job awaiting delivery must
  block provider suspend and deep-idle dispatcher throttling.
- Reply delivery is active work. Pending `reply_delivery` jobs or unconsumed
  reply heads must be treated like queued asks.
- A suspended provider must be woken before dispatching the next job to that
  provider. If wake fails, the job must fail or remain pending according to the
  existing dispatcher semantics; the request must not be silently dropped.
- `--silence` remains submit-only. The system may skip reply delivery for
  success, but it must still persist terminal failure/blocker evidence.

Minimum stable ask scenarios before enabling each slice beyond no-op write
suppression:

- plain `ask A -> B` while B is idle
- queued asks to the same target preserve order
- `ask --callback` chain `A -> B -> C -> B -> A` completes once without loops
- `ask --silence` independent child work does not wait for a reply body
- first ask after warm-idle/deep-idle/suspended state wakes the target or reports
  a clear wake failure
- cancellation/resubmit while idle still reaches the dispatcher immediately.

## Pressure Classes

### 1. Control-Plane Heartbeat Writes

Files:

- `.ccb/ccbd/lease.json`
- `.ccb/ccbd/keeper.json`
- `.ccb/ccbd/lifecycle.json`

Current issue:

- The daemon heartbeat runs on a short interval and persists heartbeat-like
  records even when no request, job, pane change, or health transition occurred.

Recommended change:

- Add heartbeat write debounce.
- Keep latest heartbeat timestamp in memory.
- Persist to disk only when:
  - lease holder or daemon generation changes
  - mount state changes
  - health/failure reason changes
  - a configurable max silence interval expires
  - shutdown/startup needs final evidence

Candidate knobs:

```text
CCB_IDLE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_S=15
CCB_DEEP_IDLE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_S=120
CCB_HEARTBEAT_PERSIST_MAX_S=60
```

Compatibility notes:

- Existing clients that inspect `lease.json` need a freshness model that allows
  debounced writes. Add a field such as `heartbeat_persisted_at` only if needed;
  otherwise keep current schema and adjust freshness logic around daemon socket
  liveness.

### 2. Runtime And Helper JSON Rewrite Amplification

Files:

- `.ccb/agents/<agent>/runtime.json`
- `.ccb/agents/<agent>/helper.json`

Current issue:

- Heartbeat steps can update runtime records with only `last_seen_at` or helper
  manifest rewrites. Atomic write means even tiny updates become file creation,
  replace, metadata churn, and SSD writes.

Recommended change:

- Add a content-stable JSON store path:
  - serialize payload
  - if target exists and bytes are identical, skip write
  - expose `skipped_noop_write_count`
- Do not rewrite helper manifests unless material fields changed.
- Treat `last_seen_at` as an in-memory heartbeat while idle; persist it only on
  state transitions or after a max interval.

Likely code areas:

- `storage/json_store.py`
- `storage/atomic.py`
- `agents/store.py`
- `provider_runtime/helper_manifest.py`
- `ccbd/services/registry.py`
- `ccbd/services/health_monitor_runtime/*`
- `ccbd/services/dispatcher_runtime/runtime_state.py`

Acceptance check:

- A no-op heartbeat across N agents should not change mtimes for
  `runtime.json` or `helper.json`.

### 3. Idle-Aware Maintenance Loop

Current issue:

- Each tick can run health monitor, runtime supervision, dispatcher runtime
  view reconciliation, dispatcher tick, completion polling, and job heartbeat.
  That is appropriate while jobs are active, but too expensive when the project
  is quiet.

Recommended change:

- Track project activity:
  - last socket request
  - pending ask queue depth
  - active jobs
  - pending callback edges
  - pending reply delivery heads or jobs
  - provider output movement
  - recent health transition
- Derive mode:
  - `active`: active job/request/recovery
  - `warm-idle`: no active work, recent user interaction
  - `deep-idle`: no active work after threshold
- Use different intervals and step sets:

```text
active:     1s, full maintenance
warm-idle: 15s, health + lightweight dispatcher checks
deep-idle: 120s, lease liveness + minimal health sampling
```

Wake rules:

- Any socket request queues immediate maintenance.
- Any ask submission exits idle mode.
- Any callback continuation, reply delivery, cancellation, resubmit, or repair
  request exits idle mode.
- Any provider output/event exits deep idle.
- Any failure/recovery condition returns to active cadence.

Likely code areas:

- `ccbd/app_runtime/lifecycle.py`
- `ccbd/socket_server_runtime/loop.py`
- `ccbd/services/dispatcher.py`
- `ccbd/services/health.py`
- `ccbd/supervision/loop.py`

### 4. Provider Runtime Tmpfs Split

Current issue:

- Provider runtime residue is mixed with project `.ccb` state. Many files are
  rebuildable and do not need SSD durability.

Move candidates:

- `provider-runtime/<provider>/`
- FIFOs
- bridge logs that are not user-facing evidence
- pid files
- activity scratch snapshots
- temporary sockets/acks

Keep on disk:

- auth
- provider session identity
- user/project config projections
- stable session transcript if required for resume
- explicit diagnostics exports

Implementation approach:

- Use existing runtime-root concepts where possible instead of inventing a
  parallel path authority.
- Add a runtime root resolver:

```text
CCB_RUNTIME_STATE_HOME=/run/user/$UID/ccb
fallback: /dev/shm/ccb-$USER
fallback: project .ccb when runtime root unavailable
```

The project `.ccb` can keep a small ref file pointing to the runtime root.

### 5. Provider Idle Suspend/Resume

Current issue:

- Mounted providers keep bridges, terminal panes, and provider CLIs alive even
  when unused. This is the biggest memory and CPU opportunity.

Recommended states:

```text
mounted -> idle -> suspended -> waking -> idle/busy
```

Suspend policy:

- Eligible only when:
  - no active job
  - queue depth is zero
  - no callback continuation waiting on that provider
  - no pending reply delivery targeting that provider
  - no active wake/recovery attempt
  - provider runtime health is stable
  - idle age exceeds configured threshold
- Persist enough resume authority:
  - agent name
  - provider
  - workspace path
  - session id/path if resumable
  - runtime generation
  - desired state

Resume policy:

- On ask or focus request, transition `suspended -> waking`.
- Start provider runtime using existing start/restore path.
- Keep accepted jobs in dispatcher authority while waking; do not submit to the
  provider transport until runtime is actionable.
- If restore fails, surface a clear error and keep the job pending or fail
  according to current dispatcher semantics.

Candidate knobs:

```text
CCB_CODEX_RUNTIME_IDLE_TIMEOUT_S=600
CCB_PROVIDER_SUSPEND_ENABLED=0
CCB_PROVIDER_SUSPEND_AFTER_S=900
CCB_PROVIDER_WAKE_TIMEOUT_S=60
```

Start with Codex opt-in because its provider-state footprint is currently the
largest observed local pressure.

### 6. Provider-State Retention And Compaction

Current issue:

- Some pressure is not continuous writes but accumulated provider-state size:
  `sessions/*.jsonl`, SQLite state, WALs, caches, and plugin bundles.

Recommended changes:

- Add maintenance command/report:

```text
ccb doctor storage
ccb cleanup --dry-run
ccb cleanup --provider-state --older-than 30d
```

- Policies:
  - checkpoint/truncate SQLite WALs for stopped or suspended providers
  - compress old session JSONL above a size threshold
  - prune rebuildable caches by age and size
  - never delete auth or active session authority by default

Codex diagnostic SQLite guardrails:

- The `logs_2.sqlite` diagnostic-log filter is a pressure mitigation, not a
  session authority change. By default managed Codex homes redirect this
  rebuildable diagnostic DB to a temp path and install a trigger that blocks all
  diagnostic inserts.
- Existing `logs_2.sqlite`, `logs_2.sqlite-wal`, and `logs_2.sqlite-shm` files
  are backed up before the symlink redirect is installed. The temp target is
  scoped by Codex home and runtime directory so multiple agents do not share one
  writable database path.
- The filter must be reversible: when `CCB_CODEX_DIAGNOSTIC_LOGS` is enabled,
  CCB removes the symlink redirect, restores the backed-up managed DB when one
  exists, and removes its trigger instead of leaving old suppression state
  behind.
- Trigger installation must be idempotent. If the expected trigger already
  exists, the installer must not drop/recreate it and must not bump SQLite
  schema state on every startup.
- `RUST_LOG=off` is only a managed default. Explicit profile or agent env must
  be able to override it for diagnostics.

Acceptance check:

- Dry-run reports storage classes before deleting or compressing anything.

## Implementation Slices

### Slice A: Measurement And Guardrails

- Add counters:
  - runtime store writes
  - helper manifest writes
  - no-op JSON write skips
  - heartbeat persist writes
  - provider RSS by provider type
  - provider idle age
  - ask submit latency and socket request queue wait
  - wake latency for first ask after idle
  - callback edge pending age and continuation submission count
- Add a diagnostic command or project view field that shows idle mode.

Risk: low.

### Slice B: No-Op Write Suppression

- Implement content-equality skip in JSON writes.
- Add helper manifest equality skip.
- Avoid saving runtime when only volatile timestamps changed under the debounce
  threshold.

Risk: low to medium. Main risk is stale diagnostic timestamps.

### Slice C: Idle Heartbeat Pacing

- Add project activity tracker.
- Run full maintenance only while active.
- Use warm/deep idle intervals when safe.
- Keep dispatcher callback repair, reply delivery repair, and job queue progress
  on active cadence whenever any ask-related work is pending.

Risk: medium. Main risk is slower detection of dead panes while idle.

### Slice D: Runtime Tmpfs

- Move rebuildable runtime dirs to runtime-state home.
- Keep project `.ccb` refs for discoverability.
- Add fallback when tmpfs is unavailable.

Risk: medium. Main risk is crash recovery and stale runtime-root refs.

### Slice E: Provider Suspend/Resume

- Implement opt-in Codex suspend first.
- Add wake path on ask.
- Add explicit sidebar/project-view status.
- Gate suspend on dispatcher and message-bureau activity, not only provider pane
  idleness.

Risk: medium to high. Main risk is resume latency and provider-specific
restore differences.

## Verification Plan

Baseline before each slice:

```bash
ps -eo pid,cmd | rg 'ccbd|provider_backends|/codex '
cat /proc/<pid>/io
find <project>/.ccb -type f -mmin -2 -printf '%T@ %s %p\n'
du -h -d 5 <project>/.ccb | sort -h | tail
```

Automated tests:

- Unit tests for no-op JSON write skip.
- Unit tests for runtime/helper debounce.
- Unit tests for idle-mode transitions from active to warm-idle to deep-idle.
- Integration test for ask waking a suspended provider.
- Integration test for queued asks preserving order across idle wake.
- Integration test for callback continuation across idle wake:
  parent -> child -> grandchild -> child -> parent.
- Integration test proving pending callback and reply-delivery work blocks
  provider suspend.
- Integration test for cancel/resubmit while project is deep-idle.
- Regression test for `ccb kill`, `ccb -n`, callback continuation, and
  project restart.

Manual acceptance:

- Run a project with 10 mounted Codex agents and no active jobs for 10 minutes.
- Confirm file mtimes for runtime/helper records are mostly stable.
- Confirm `/proc/<pid>/io` write deltas are near zero outside max-persist
  windows.
- Submit an ask and confirm the provider wakes and completes.
- Run the ask stability scenarios above with idle pacing enabled before turning
  on provider suspend.

## Open Questions

- What is the minimum persisted heartbeat freshness external tools require?
- Should provider suspend be per-agent, per-provider, or project-wide?
- Which provider session files are mandatory for resume and which are only
  diagnostics?
- Should compressed old sessions remain transparent to existing session readers?
- Should idle defaults be enabled globally or only for high-agent-count
  projects at first?
- What is the maximum acceptable wake latency for the first ask after deep idle
  or suspend?
- Should pending callback/reply-delivery state fully block deep idle, or only
  block provider suspend while keeping reduced control-plane heartbeat writes?
