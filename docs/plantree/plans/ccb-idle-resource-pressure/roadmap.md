# Roadmap

Date: 2026-06-23

## Done

- Removed callback-ledger idle read amplification (2026-08-01): callback
  latest-state queries now load append-only JSONL once and reuse an
  inode/size/mtime-validated memory view; callback repair takes one locked
  snapshot, skips historical submitted continuations unless their linked job
  is still queued, skips pending edges whose child is still outstanding, and
  batches crash-window job-history discovery once per target. A production-
  shape 2,953-row/18.51 MB source-runtime smoke reduced `dispatcher_tick` from
  about 26.8 seconds to about 0.25 ms and sampled idle `ccbd` at 0.4% CPU with
  no physical reads.
- Diagnosed and bounded a production pane-crash write storm (2026-07-30):
  one 70.6-hour `ccbd` had written about 71.9 GB while two provider panes
  crashed every 30 seconds, producing 19,602 crash logs. The source fix now
  makes respawn provisional for 90 seconds, blocks dispatch during probing,
  applies 30s/60s/120s/5m/10m/30m recovery backoff, opens a circuit after six
  unstable attempts, retains at most 50 crash artifacts per runtime, clears
  stale pane history before respawn, and skips unchanged helper-manifest
  writes.
- Added provider-specific containment for the observed causes: stale Claude
  `--continue` state is repaired without touching authentication, while a
  missing Codex managed app server fails closed and requests explicit
  restart/remount.
- Identified the idle pressure classes from live local diagnosis:
  daemon heartbeat writes, agent runtime/helper rewrite amplification, provider
  bridge/CLI residency, provider SQLite/session writes, and shared-cache disk
  footprint.
- Separated "space at rest" problems from "continuous write" problems so the
  first implementation slice can target SSD wear and idle churn.
- Identified that the `v7.6.14` Codex `logs_2.sqlite` mitigation was partial:
  the trigger-only policy did not move writes off durable storage and preserved
  some diagnostic rows, so it could still leave measurable write pressure.
- Implemented and corrected the Codex diagnostic SQLite policy in the working
  tree: managed `logs_2.sqlite` redirects to temp storage, existing DB/sidecars
  are backed up, CCB no longer pre-creates Codex-owned SQLite schema, trigger
  installation waits until Codex migration creates `logs`, diagnostics mode can
  restore the original DB, and symlink failure falls back to an in-place trigger.
- Added self-healing for temp DBs created by the bad intermediate policy:
  a symlink target with `logs` but no successful Codex migration record is moved
  aside so Codex can recreate it through its own migration path.
- Verified the corrected policy with `PYTHONPATH=lib pytest -q
  test/test_codex_diagnostic_log_filter.py
  test/test_codex_launcher_diagnostics_env.py test/test_v2_runtime_launch.py`
  plus `python -m compileall -q
  lib/provider_backends/codex/launcher_runtime/command_runtime/diagnostics.py
  lib/provider_backends/codex/launcher_runtime/command_runtime/home.py` and
  `git diff --check`.
- Source runtime smoke under
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/codex-log-migration-smoke-20260623` passed:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/ccb_test config validate`, `ccb_test -s`, and
  `ccb_test doctor` mounted one Codex agent without `table logs already exists`;
  `logs_2.sqlite` pointed to temp storage, Codex migration records existed, the
  CCB insert-block trigger was installed, and `ccb_test kill -f` stopped the
  smoke runtime.
- Confirmed `state_5.sqlite*` was not a release-blocking idle pressure path in
  local sampling; keep it under measurement rather than adding a speculative
  mitigation now.

## In Progress

- Review and harden PR234, now rebased cleanly onto `origin/main` `v7.6.19`.
  The PR contains five review slices: Claude callback completion capture,
  optional Rust runtime accelerator, Codex idle polling reduction, ccbd/keeper/
  ProjectView write-churn reduction, and release/CI packaging. See
  [topics/pr234-runtime-accelerator-review.md](topics/pr234-runtime-accelerator-review.md).
- Package/CI hardening for the runtime accelerator has been added during review:
  release artifacts build and ship `bin/ccb-runtime-accelerator`, CI tests the
  Rust crate, and install links the packaged binary when present.

## Next

1. Ship the callback-ledger fix, restart the affected project only after the
   release is installed, and verify heartbeat freshness plus `/proc` CPU/read
   deltas against the 2026-08-01 production baseline.
2. Finish PR234 full regression gates after the packaging and callback-hot-work
   fixes: targeted provider/accelerator tests, ccbd idle tests, Rust
   fmt/test/build, compileall, diff check, and any affordable release script
   dry-run.
3. Use [topics/worker-execution-goal.md](topics/worker-execution-goal.md) as
   the worker contract for phased landing, tests, source runtime validation, and
   plan-tree evidence updates.
4. Add an ask-stability gate for every idle optimization:
   plain ask submit, queued ask, callback continuation, reply delivery, cancel,
   resubmit, and first ask after idle or suspend.
5. Add measurement hooks for idle write bytes, runtime-store save count, helper
   manifest save count, provider process RSS, and provider idle age.
6. Add content-equality and debounce guards around JSON runtime writes:
   `runtime.json`, `helper.json`, lifecycle records, and lease heartbeat.
7. Introduce idle-mode heartbeat pacing:
   active interval, idle interval, deep-idle interval, and immediate wake on
   incoming socket requests.
8. Move rebuildable runtime residue toward tmpfs:
   provider-runtime, FIFOs, bridge scratch state, activity snapshots, and
   transient pid/socket markers.
9. Add provider idle suspend/resume for mounted-but-unused agents, starting with
   an opt-in Codex policy.
10. Add cleanup/compaction for provider-state:
   WAL checkpoint, session JSONL size policy, old cache pruning, and shared
   cache retention limits.

## Deferred

- Default provider suspend for every provider type before Codex behavior is
  proven.
- Rewriting provider session storage.
- Removing persistent sessions or auth material.
- Moving durable auth/session authority to tmpfs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- With 10 mounted idle Codex agents, idle daemon+provider write rate drops by at
  least 90% compared with the baseline sample.
- Idle provider RSS drops materially when suspend is enabled, without losing
  the ability to route a later ask.
- First ask after idle either starts immediately or reports a clear "waking"
  state, then proceeds without manual intervention.
- `ccb kill`, `ccb -n`, project restart, and callback continuation retain their
  current semantics.
- `ask` remains stable across idle policies:
  plain ask accepts quickly, queued ask remains ordered, callback continuation is
  delivered once, `--silence` does not require a reply, and reply delivery does
  not loop or disappear.
- Runtime files still provide enough evidence for diagnostics after a crash.
