# Grok CCB Skills Design

Date: 2026-07-11

## Goal

Give every CCB-managed Grok instance native, instance-local `ask` and
`ccb-clear` skills that work in visible TUI and headless ask execution without
sharing another provider's home or granting broad terminal permission.

The design covers skill content, projection ownership, caller identity,
permission policy, failure behavior, and acceptance. It does not change Grok's
provider-native completion authority.

## Package Shape

Add exactly two Grok-native skill packages:

```text
inherit_skills/grok_skills/
  ask/
    SKILL.md
  ccb-clear/
    SKILL.md
```

Do not add scripts, references, assets, or `agents/openai.yaml`. Both workflows
are short CLI contracts; the CCB commands already own parsing, validation,
artifacts, routing, and clear behavior. Grok ignores Codex UI metadata, so it
must not be copied into the Grok package.

Each `SKILL.md` frontmatter contains only `name` and `description`. Runtime
permission is CCB launcher policy, not skill metadata.

## Ask Skill Contract

Name and trigger description:

```yaml
---
name: ask
description: Delegate work or request information from another CCB-managed agent using ask. Use when the user asks Grok to ask, delegate to, hand off to, consult, or send work to a named CCB agent, or when project memory requires CCB collaboration.
---
```

Body requirements:

1. Decide whether delegation is actually required.
2. Select result intent before invoking the command:
   `--silence`, `--compact`, plain `ask`, or `--chain`, with artifact flags
   remaining orthogonal.
3. Use `--chain` when the current active CCB task needs the child result; use
   `--silence` for independent no-result work. Do not issue a plain nested ask
   from an active task.
4. Send the request body through a quoted heredoc:

   ```bash
   command ask [FLAGS...] "$TARGET" <<'EOF'
   $MESSAGE
   EOF
   ```

5. Submit once, then stop. Do not run `ask get`, `pend`, `watch`, or `ping`
   unless the user explicitly requested diagnostics.
6. Do not append completion markers or output-policy text. CCB owns reply
   guidance, artifacts, continuation routing, and Grok native completion.
7. If terminal permission is denied or cancelled, report the request as not
   submitted. Do not toggle always-approve, edit Grok permission config, or
   claim success.
8. If `--chain` is rejected because no active parent exists, retry once with
   plain `ask` only when the user requested independent delegation.

The Grok template should preserve the shared ask decision-card assertions in
`test/test_ask_skill_templates.py`; provider-specific wording may be added only
for permission failure and native completion boundaries.

## CCB Clear Skill Contract

Name and trigger description:

```yaml
---
name: ccb-clear
description: Clear conversation context for one or more mounted CCB agents using ccb clear. Use when the user invokes /ccb-clear, $ccb-clear, or $ccb_clear, or asks Grok to clear or reset CCB agent context without restarting agents or deleting project state.
---
```

Body requirements:

1. Preserve explicit scope:
   - bare `/ccb-clear`, `$ccb-clear`, or `$ccb_clear`, and explicit all-agents
     requests: `command ccb clear`;
   - named agents: pass only those names as separately shell-quoted arguments;
   - ambiguous natural-language scope without a direct skill invocation: ask
     for the target instead of clearing every agent.
2. Explain only operationally relevant behavior: clear sends provider-native
   clear input to mounted target panes and does not delete `.ccb`, auth,
   sessions, logs, workspaces, or memory files.
3. Never substitute `ccb kill`, `ccb -n`, `restart`, direct tmux input, or file
   deletion.
4. Run once, report the command output, then stop. Do not poll.
5. On permission denial or cancellation, report that no clear was performed.
   Do not change Grok permission mode.
6. In the `ccb_source` checkout, retain the existing source/runtime isolation
   warning: installed `ccb` is for the active collaboration environment;
   source validation uses the absolute external `ccb_test` wrapper.

## Native Projection Contract

For agent `<agent>`, project the packages to:

```text
.ccb/agents/<agent>/provider-state/grok/home/.grok/skills/ask/SKILL.md
.ccb/agents/<agent>/provider-state/grok/home/.grok/skills/ccb-clear/SKILL.md
```

Projection rules:

- Project each skill directory independently. Do not replace or symlink the
  entire `.grok/skills` directory because Grok owns bundled skills there.
- Use CCB projection markers beside each managed skill directory so refresh
  and removal are idempotent and ownership is inspectable.
- Refresh during provider workspace preparation, visible launcher command
  construction, and per-job headless environment construction.
- `inherit_skills = false` removes only the two CCB-owned skill directories and
  markers. Preserve auth, config, sessions, logs, bundled skills, and unrelated
  user-created skills.
- A conflicting unmarked `ask` or `ccb-clear` directory in the managed home is
  a diagnostic conflict. Do not silently delete unknown content.
- Storage inventory classifies the two managed skill paths and markers as
  projected configuration; other `.grok/skills` content keeps its provider
  state classification.

## Caller Identity Contract

Visible Grok already receives caller context from the launcher. Headless Grok
must receive an equivalent per-agent caller environment built from its session
payload:

```text
CCB_CALLER_ACTOR=<agent>
CCB_CALLER_RUNTIME_DIR=<agent grok runtime dir>
CCB_CALLER_PROJECT_ROOT=<project root>
CCB_CALLER_PROJECT_ID=<project id>
CCB_SESSION_ID=<agent launch session id>
```

Source-test PATH routing from `caller_context_env()` must also be preserved so
skill commands use the external project's source wrapper rather than the
installed release. Do not inherit caller identity from the `ccbd` parent
process; that can attribute Grok delegation to the wrong agent or project.

## Permission Contract

Skill discovery does not grant terminal permission. CCB must keep permission
policy separate from skill content.

Normal start with auto permission enabled:

- When `inherit_skills = true`, add only Grok CLI allow rules matching the
  exact skill command prefixes:
  - `Bash(command ask *)`
  - `Bash(command ccb clear*)`
- Apply the same narrow rules to the visible Grok command and per-job headless
  Grok command.
- Persist the effective skill-command permission bit in the Grok session
  payload so later jobs and daemon recovery use the same start policy.

Safe start with auto permission disabled:

- Do not append either allow rule.
- Visible TUI asks the user for approval.
- Headless tool execution may end as native `Cancelled`; CCB reports
  incomplete and must not pretend the skill command ran.

Additional rules:

- `inherit_skills = false` disables both projection and CCB-added allow rules.
- User/enterprise deny rules and hooks always win.
- Never add `--always-approve`, `bypassPermissions`, a general `Bash` allow, or
  permission-file rewrites for these skills.
- Skill instructions cannot override permission policy.

## Runtime And Completion Behavior

- The skill command's exit status determines whether submission or clear was
  accepted; skill prose is not execution evidence.
- For `ask`, the child CCB job follows normal CCB async/chain semantics.
- The outer Grok job still completes only from provider-native Grok terminal
  evidence. Skill output, child completion, process exit, `CCB_DONE`, and CCB
  turn text are not Grok completion authority.
- `ccb-clear` does not wait for semantic provider output beyond the CCB command
  result. It reports the returned per-target clear status and stops.

## Failure Behavior

| Condition | Required result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skill source missing | Remove stale managed projection; report projection unavailable in diagnostics. |
| Unmarked conflicting skill directory | Preserve it and report ownership conflict. |
| Terminal permission denied/cancelled | No success claim; outer Grok result is blocked/incomplete according to native end reason. |
| Wrong or missing caller context | Reject acceptance; do not fall back to another project or agent identity. |
| Unknown ask/clear target | Return CCB validation error; do not retarget automatically. |
| `ccb -s` headless command | Permission remains interactive/unavailable; do not bypass safe-start policy. |
| Child ask submitted | Stop; do not poll unless diagnostics were explicitly requested. |

## Test Matrix

Skill content:

- Grok `ask` participates in the shared ask-template contract.
- Both files have valid Grok frontmatter, concise descriptions, ASCII content,
  quoted command examples, and no broad permission instructions.
- `ccb-clear` contains all/named/ambiguous scope rules and forbids kill,
  restart, direct tmux input, and state deletion.

Projection and storage:

- Enabled projection creates both instance-local paths and markers.
- Repeated materialization is idempotent.
- Disabled inheritance removes only marked CCB skill paths.
- Conflicting unmarked paths are preserved and diagnosed.
- Bundled Grok skills, auth, config, sessions, and logs survive enable/disable.
- Storage classification distinguishes CCB-managed skill paths from Grok-owned
  bundled skills.

Launcher and execution:

- Normal start adds each narrow allow rule exactly once to visible and headless
  commands.
- Safe start and `inherit_skills = false` add no rules.
- Headless env binds the correct agent, runtime, project, session, and
  source-test PATH.
- `grok1` and `grok2` never share skill paths, caller identity, or completion
  artifacts.

Real acceptance in `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2`:

1. `grok inspect --json` reports both skills from each managed home.
2. Normal-start headless `grok1` uses `ask --silence` to submit to `grok2`
   without an interactive permission prompt; target and sender are exact.
3. Safe-start headless invocation is cancelled/incomplete without executing
   the child command.
4. Visible safe-start invocation succeeds only after explicit approval.
5. Grok invokes `ccb-clear` for one named test agent; no other pane receives
   clear input, and post-clear asks still route correctly.
6. `inherit_skills = false` removes both discoveries and both CCB-added allow
   rules while preserving unrelated Grok state.
7. Restart one Grok instance and repeat ask plus clear attribution checks.

## Non-Goals

- Do not create a combined `ccb` skill.
- Do not expose diagnostics polling as normal ask behavior.
- Do not broaden Grok terminal permissions beyond the two CCB commands.
- Do not use global Claude/Codex skill compatibility as Grok's CCB skill
  source.
- Do not change Grok provider-native result collection or turn-end authority.
