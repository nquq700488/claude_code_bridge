# Managed Tool Windows Plan

Date: 2026-05-30

## Purpose

Plan first-class CCB-managed non-agent windows such as a default `neovim`
window. A tool window is visible in the sidebar as a single window row and is
managed by the project tmux namespace, but it is not an agent and must not
participate in ask routing, provider runtime, health monitoring, completion
tracking, or Comms.

This plan exists separately from the agent hot-reload plan because the core
model is a new topology primitive. Reload is one integration path, not the
authority for the feature.

  landed Linux/tmux implementation slice for parser runtimepath preservation,
  read-only doctor capabilities, Snacks folder defaults, guarded Markdown, and
  Treesitter no-auto-install policy.
- [history/neovim-open-fallback-slice-2026-06-14.md](history/neovim-open-fallback-slice-2026-06-14.md):
  landed conservative OS-integration slice for external open/reveal commands,
  WSL mounted-drive diagnostics, and Linux/tmux source-wrapper validation.

  landed first CCB-owned workbench bundle slice for WezTerm/Yazi/LazyVim and
  Markdown/PDF/video helpers, with isolated profiles, manifest, lifecycle
  commands, and Linux/tmux source-wrapper validation.
- [history/rich-layout-alias-slice-2026-06-15.md](history/rich-layout-alias-slice-2026-06-15.md):
  landed `rich` as a reserved layout alias that can be mounted in `[windows]`
  like provider panes while remaining outside agent communication/runtime.
- [history/rich-update-entry-slice-2026-06-15.md](history/rich-update-entry-slice-2026-06-15.md):
  landed `ccb update rich` as the single rich install/update entry, removed
  the `rich-install` alias, and removed standalone public Neovim tool routes.

  including `test_ccb2` validation.

  browser-preview, clipboard, and plugin-pinning defaults.
- [decisions/004-optional-rich-terminal-workbench.md](decisions/004-optional-rich-terminal-workbench.md):
  decision record for treating the rich terminal workbench as an optional
  recommended profile rather than a hard CCB dependency.
- [decisions/005-rich-owns-neovim.md](decisions/005-rich-owns-neovim.md):
  decision record for moving Neovim/LazyVim out of the normal CCB tool surface
  and into the optional rich bundle.

## Scope

In scope:

- A config-level `tool_windows` concept for windows that run a command such as
  `nvim`.
- Cold-start materialization of managed tool windows.
- Project view and sidebar rendering as one window row with no child agent row.
- Explicit `ccb reload` add/remove behavior for idle managed tool windows.
- Project/session-scoped tmux identity and UI settings.
- A single optional rich workbench lifecycle. Normal `ccb install` and
  `ccb update` must not install or refresh Neovim/LazyVim; rich provisioning is
  requested explicitly through the rich command surface such as
  `ccb update rich`.
- tmux compatibility settings applied at CCB session/window scope, not through
  user-global tmux config edits.
- Tests proving tool windows do not become agents or provider runtime records.

Out of scope for the first slice:

- Tool windows participating in `ask`, Comms, provider status, or completion.
- Arbitrary tool pane layouts inside one tool window.
- Background config watching.
- Automatic replacement of a running tool command after its command changes.
- Treating a tool window as a terminal multiplexer workspace independent of
  CCB ownership.
- Mutating a user's existing `~/.config/nvim`, Neovim data/cache/state
  directories, or global tmux configuration.
