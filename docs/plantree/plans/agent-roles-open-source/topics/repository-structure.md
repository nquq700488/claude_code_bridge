## Ownership

- `specs/` is the authority for RolePack semantics.
- `schemas/` supports validation, but should not overtake the human spec
  before fields stabilize.
- `templates/` demonstrates how to start a role.
- `reference_roles/` demonstrates complete roles.
- `adapters/` documents host contracts; it should not contain full runtime
  implementations in v0.1.
- `conformance/` documents validation expectations and later becomes the
  compatibility test suite.
- `cli/` should be empty or documentation-only until the spec preview is
  stable.

## Role Directory Shape

A concrete role can contain:

```text
role/
  README.md
  role.toml
  memory.md
  skills/
  prompts/
  tools/
  plugins/
  adapters/
  tests/
```

Only the minimal metadata and at least one useful role content source should be
required in v0.1. The exact manifest shape can stay conservative until the
first schema stabilizes.
