# CCB Mobile

Native Android/iOS/iPadOS remote controller for server-side CCB tmux projects.

This directory is the authoritative CCB Mobile source inside the CCB monorepo.
The legacy standalone `ccb_mobile` repository is retired as an implementation
surface and now exists only for migration/runtime compatibility notes.

CCB and provider CLIs run on the server; the mobile app is a controller for
project discovery, agent switching, terminal access, Markdown reading,
notifications, local/Tailnet gateway access, and file transfer.

## Android Alpha Release

CCB Mobile v8.2.1 is published as an Android APK:

- [Download ccb-mobile-v8.2.1.apk](https://github.com/SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge/releases/download/v8.2.1/ccb-mobile-v8.2.1.apk)
- Server setup entrypoint: `ccb update mobile`
- App source: [`app/`](app/)

The app is designed for real server-side CCB projects, not a demo-only flow.
It connects to the server-wide mobile gateway, lists mounted CCB projects,
renders agent transcripts, sends pane-native text input, opens terminal views,
and supports image/document upload and download through the authenticated
gateway.

iOS/iPadOS remain source-supported targets, but v8.2.1 release validation is
Android-focused.
