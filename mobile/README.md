# CCB Mobile

Native Android/iOS/iPadOS remote controller for server-side CCB tmux projects.

This is the mobile app source inside the CCB monorepo. CCB and provider CLIs
run on the server; the mobile app is a controller for project discovery, agent
switching, terminal access, Markdown reading, notifications, local/Tailnet
gateway access, and file transfer.

## Android Alpha Release

CCB Mobile v8.0.1 is published as an Android APK:

- [Download ccb-mobile-v8.0.1.apk](https://github.com/bfly123/claude_code_bridge/releases/download/v8.0.1/ccb-mobile-v8.0.1.apk)
- Server setup entrypoint: `ccb update mobile`
- App source: [`app/`](app/)

The app is designed for real server-side CCB projects, not a demo-only flow.
It connects to the server-wide mobile gateway, lists mounted CCB projects,
renders agent transcripts, sends pane-native text input, opens terminal views,
and supports image/document upload and download through the authenticated
gateway.

iOS/iPadOS remain source-supported targets, but v8.0.1 release validation is
Android-focused.
