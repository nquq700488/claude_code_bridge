# Mobile Tmux Control Plan

Date: 2026-06-17
Status: In Progress

## Purpose

Design a mobile and iPad remote-control surface for CCB that connects to
server-side CCB tmux workspaces and preserves CCB's existing multi-project and
multi-agent ownership model.

The product is agent-first and server-remote: the main job is readable control
of CCB projects and named agents running on a server. Raw terminal/tmux control
must remain available, but it is an explicit control/debug fallback rather
than the default project page. The app should not become an independent mobile
agent application.

## Context

CCB already treats tmux as a managed runtime detail:

- one `.ccb` anchor owns one `ccbd` backend;
- one backend owns one project tmux namespace and long-lived session;
- panes, windows, and provider runtime records are reconciled by `ccbd`;
- `pane_id` values are evidence, not durable identity;
- foreground attach is only a UI connection and must not imply lifecycle
  ownership.

Relevant CCB source-of-truth documents live in the source checkout:

## Current Direction

Build a native Flutter phone/iPad client around a CCB-scoped pane-backed
chat-first agent workspace with explicit raw-terminal fallback:

1. Connect the phone/iPad to CCB projects and named agents on the server.
2. Default to a project page with a top agent switcher, exactly one selected
   agent, a vertically scrollable conversation timeline, and a persistent
   bottom composer.
3. Submit normal user input by writing to the selected agent's CCB-validated
   tmux pane through the existing terminal transport; do not add an `ask`
   wrapper above the pane.
4. Render provider-native transcript, pane output, and retained scrollback into
   compact chat-style entries. CCB ask/job history is supplemental
   compatibility data, not the default conversation source. Full raw
   terminal/tmux control remains available through explicit Open Terminal
   actions and per-agent Terminal mode with keyboard, paste, resize, and
   reconnect support.
5. Move project path, gateway URL, pairing code, runtime id, route diagnostics,
   and low-level terminal state behind connection details or settings.
6. Discover CCB projects and agents through `ccbd`, not raw filesystem scans or
   arbitrary tmux sessions.
7. Use `project_view` as the side data model for project, window, agent,
   activity, Comms, and health state.
8. Use existing focus endpoints when the user explicitly changes CCB-managed
   focus.
9. Use a server-level mobile gateway and project registry so the phone sees
   all mounted/reachable CCB projects on that server, then keep a frequent
   project list that can open, wake, and close those projects.
10. Show named agents with fast switching, state, completion, callback, and
   health indicators.
11. Render pane-derived output, Comms, replies, artifacts, Markdown, and math
   formulas in a readable mobile/iPad timeline.
12. Keep destructive tmux operations gated or disabled unless `ccbd` owns the
   action.
13. Use LAN/manual URL for local validation, CCB Relay as the default
   not-on-LAN route, Tailnet as a stable private route, and Cloudflare Tunnel
   as an advanced route while keeping the app and gateway protocol
   relay-compatible.
14. Use a server-wide low-sensitive notification event stream for app-lifetime
    task-completion system notifications, with every paired client eligible to
    notify and push-level killed-app delivery deferred.

## Initial Recommendation

For the native server-remote path:

- use ServerBox as the preferred native fork candidate if an AGPL mobile app
  component is acceptable;
- use MuxPod as the strongest tmux-specific mobile UX and command-strategy
  reference;
- use tmux-mobile as the best MIT reference for a server-side
  WebSocket/xterm/tmux gateway;
- use Paseo as the strongest reference for QR pairing, daemon/client protocol,
  relay, terminal frames, and agent-mobile workflow;
- keep Termux, Blink, ConnectBot, mosh, and ttyd as narrower reference points,
  not product bases.
- use CCB Relay as the default public remote access path for ordinary users,
  keep Tailnet as the stable private route, keep Cloudflare Tunnel as an
  advanced/self-hosted option, and preserve local LAN/manual URL validation for
  emulator and same-network testing.

The CCB-specific product should remain server-remote: CCB and provider CLIs run
on the server, while the native client is a CCB-aware controller for projects,
selected-agent workspaces, content, notifications, and explicit terminal/pane
control when needed.
