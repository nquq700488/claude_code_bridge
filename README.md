## Why Multi Agents

A single agent is enough for small tasks. Once work needs planning, parallel edits, review, testing, and handoff, multi agents help separate roles, context, models, and execution. CCB focuses on putting multiple real CLI agents into one visible terminal workspace.

| Value | Plain meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| Role separation | `main` plans, `worker` implements, `reviewer` checks risk. |
| Parallel progress | One agent can edit while another reads docs, validates, or reviews. |
| Model and context layering | Different agents can use different providers, models, APIs, worktrees, and memory. |

<details>
<summary><b>Why one agent starts to struggle</b></summary>

- Mixed roles reduce context focus: one conversation tries to architect, edit, test, and review itself.
- Complex task execution has a ceiling: long work needs split points, handoffs, checks, and rollback boundaries.
- Cost pressure is higher: if every step needs the strongest model, even simple sub-tasks become expensive.
- Tool and skill management becomes harder: a "does everything" agent also accumulates too much authority and instruction load.
- Serial waiting is inefficient: when one agent is reading logs or running tests, other independent work cannot naturally continue.

</details>

## Which Multi-Agent Approach Should You Use?

Multi-agent systems are not one fixed shape. Use the short table first; expand the details only if you are comparing tradeoffs.

| Approach | One-line summary | Best fit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Claude Code native subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) / [agent teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) | Native delegation inside Claude Code. | You mostly stay in Claude Code and want more coordination handled by a Claude lead. |
| [Hive / OpenHive](https://github.com/aden-hive/hive) | Production-oriented multi-agent workflow harness. | You need state, recovery, observability, cost controls, and graph workflows. |
| CCB | Visible, controllable local CLI-agent workspace with mixed providers. | You want Codex, Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, and other real CLIs in one project terminal. |

<details>
<summary><b>Details: model choice, control, context, and complex workflows</b></summary>

| Question | Claude Code native | Hive / OpenHive | CCB |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Different model vendors? | Can choose Claude models for teammates/subagents; overall path is still Claude Code. | LiteLLM route covers many hosted and local providers. | Choose Codex, Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, Droid, and per-agent model/key/url. |
| Is the process visible? | In-process or split panes depending on mode. | Runtime observability and dashboard-style control. | Real tmux panes by default; users can click, type, copy, and inspect each CLI. |
| Is topology controllable? | Natural-language teammate setup, with much coordination handled by the lead. | Goal-generated graph-like topology, harness oriented. | Config explicitly defines agents, windows, panes, worktrees, and sidebar behavior. |
| Is context manageable? | Subagents/teammates have separate contexts; teams have task and message state. | Role memory, durable state, and recovery are core design points. | Each CLI keeps its provider session; shared project memory and per-agent memory are optional. |
| Best landing zone | Fast delegation inside Claude Code. | Business automation, long-running workflows, production reliability. | Local development with visible cross-provider CLI agents. |

CCB also supports complex workflows, but it is not an automatic DAG generator. You design complexity explicitly through `.ccb/ccb.config`, windows, role memory, worktrees, model/API settings, and ask/callback routes.

</details>

## What Is CCB?

CCB is a project-level agent CLI workspace. It uses tmux to manage multiple real CLI agents and unifies startup, restore, communication, configuration, windows, and runtime state for one project.

- **Real CLI sessions, not fake panels**: every agent pane runs the actual provider CLI.
- **Visible collaboration**: the sidebar shows windows, agents, status, and communication; users can switch panes by mouse.
- **Mixed providers**: one project can run Codex, Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, and Droid together.
- **Project config**: `.ccb/ccb.config` defines the team, layout, windows, worktrees, model, key, and url.
- **Recoverable runtime**: CCB supervises agent panes and supports attach, restore, and project-scoped cleanup.
- **Explicit collaboration channel**: agents can delegate through `/ask`, `$ask`, callback, and silence routes.

## v7 UI Tour

This screenshot is a real dark terminal session from the `ccb_test2` project. The labels explain the regions; you do not need to memorize every shortcut first.

<p align="center">

</p>

| Region | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sidebar | Shows the current window, agent list, provider labels, selected agent, and status hints. |
| Comms | Shows ask/callback communication and collaboration status. |
| Agent pane | Each pane is a real CLI session, such as Codex or Claude. |
| Current input target | The status bar and pane border show where your input goes. |
| Status bar | Shows project name, current agent, CCB version, date, and mouse/keyboard hints. |
| Window grouping | v7 `[windows]` can group agents into main, work, review, research, or other workflow windows. |

The sidebar implementation uses ideas from [tmux-agent-sidebar](https://github.com/hiroppy/tmux-agent-sidebar). Thanks to that project.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install or update

New users should start from a release package. Download the matching package from [Releases](https://github.com/SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge/releases), then install it:

```bash
tar -xzf ccb-*.tar.gz
cd ccb-*
./install.sh install
```

If CCB is already installed:

```bash
ccb update
```

<details>
<summary><b>Source install is for development or fallback use</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge.git
cd claude_codex_bridge
./install.sh install
```

Source installs link global `ccb` / `ask` back to the checkout. Regular users should prefer a stable release install or update.

</details>

### 2. Create project config

Create `.ccb/ccb.config` in your project root. For v7, it is better to understand config from multi-window topology first: `[windows]` defines tmux windows and agent groups, `agent:provider` defines which CLI each agent uses, and `(worktree)` gives an agent its own git worktree.

```toml
version = 2
entry_window = "main"

[windows]
main = "main:codex"
work = "worker1:codex(worktree), worker2:claude(worktree)"
review = "reviewer:claude, qa:gemini"

[ui.sidebar]
mode = "every_window"
width = "15%"
bottom_height = 20
```

If you are not sure how to group windows, how many workers you need, which agents should use worktrees, or which agents need separate models or API routes, ask an agent with the `ccb-config` skill to discuss and generate the config proposal with you.

Validate the config:

```bash
ccb config validate
```

Start the workspace:

```bash
ccb
```

### 3. Collaborate

Type directly in an agent pane, or route work between agents:

```text
/ask reviewer review the latest parser changes and list blocking issues.
```

## Daily Operation

| Goal | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| Start or reattach the current project workspace | `ccb` |
| Safe start, keeping configured/manual permission behavior | `ccb -s` |
| Rebuild runtime state while keeping config and same-name managed agent history | `ccb -n` |
| Stop this project's background runtime | `ccb kill` |
| Force cleanup before rebuilding | `ccb kill -f` then `ccb -n` |
| Update to the latest stable release | `ccb update` |
| Inspect the active config layer | `ccb config validate` |

## tmux Basics

CCB can be used mostly with the mouse, but learning a few tmux shortcuts makes daily work much faster. This section lists only common tmux keyboard operations.

In this section, `<prefix>` means `Ctrl-b`: **press `Ctrl-b`, release it, then press the function key**. Use an English input method for the function key so punctuation keys are not intercepted by another IME.

| Goal | Function key | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Move to an adjacent pane | `Arrow keys` | Select the pane above, below, left, or right. |
| Move to the next pane | `o` | Fast rotation when direction does not matter. |
| Zoom / unzoom current pane | `z` | Useful for long output, diffs, and logs. |
| Open window / pane list | `w` | Pick a target in larger layouts. |
| Next window | `n` | Switch to the next tmux window. |
| Previous window | `p` | Switch to the previous tmux window. |
| Jump to numbered window | `0` to `9` | Jump directly by tmux window number. |
| Enter copy / scroll mode | `[` | Review history, scroll, and select text. |
| Exit copy / scroll mode | `q` or `Esc` | Return to normal input. |
| Paste tmux buffer | `]` | Paste content copied into tmux's own buffer. |
| Detach session | `d` | Leave the display without stopping CCB; you can reattach later. |

Copy and paste tips:

- **Mouse copy**: in most terminals, drag with the left mouse button to copy; if tmux captures the drag, enter copy / scroll mode first.
- **Bypass tmux selection**: many terminals support `Shift + mouse drag` for native terminal selection.
- **System paste**: Linux/Windows terminals usually use `Ctrl+Shift+V`; macOS terminals usually use `Cmd+V`.
- **tmux paste**: if the content is in the tmux buffer, use function key `]`.

<details>
<summary><b>More common tmux operations</b></summary>

| Goal | Function key | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Scroll in copy / scroll mode | `PageUp` / `PageDown` / `Arrow keys` | Terminal support can vary. |
| Search in copy / scroll mode | `Ctrl-s` / `Ctrl-r` | Commonly forward / backward search. |
| Create a window | `c` | Use only when you intentionally need another shell. |
| Rename a window | `,` | Helps identify multi-window workflows. |
| Show tmux key help | `?` | Useful when you forget a shortcut. |

New users should avoid pane/window killing shortcuts at first. To stop a CCB project, prefer CCB's project-level shutdown command instead of killing one recoverable pane by accident.

</details>

## Configure Your Agent Team

CCB resolves config in three layers, from lowest to highest priority:

1. Built-in default config.
2. User config at `~/.ccb/ccb.config`.
3. Project config at `.ccb/ccb.config`.

Higher layers replace lower layers as a whole; they are not merged. The project authority file is `.ccb/ccb.config`. The old `.ccb_config/ccb.config` path is legacy migration evidence only.

`.ccb/ccb.config` mainly controls:

| Config area | Syntax or location | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Window grouping | `[windows]` | Group agents into tmux windows such as `main`, `work`, `review`, or `research`. |
| Agent name and provider | `main:codex`, `reviewer:claude` | Names are used by the UI, ask routing, and memory files; provider decides which CLI starts. |
| Workspace isolation | `worker1:codex(worktree)` | Gives implementation agents isolated git worktrees to reduce accidental overlap. |
| Sidebar behavior | `[ui.sidebar]` | Controls whether the sidebar appears in every window, plus width and Comms height. |
| Per-agent model/API | `[agents.<name>]` | Configure `model`, `key`, `url`, and related agent-local overrides. |
| Role description | `[agents.<name>] description = "..."` | Give an agent a short responsibility note; longer workflow rules belong in memory. |

If you want to discuss the configuration before writing it by hand, use the `ccb-config` skill and describe the target team. It proposes a complete config first, then writes `.ccb/ccb.config` only after confirmation.

<details>
<summary><b>Config format examples: single window, multi-window, per-agent model/API</b></summary>

### Single-window compact config

```text
cmd; main:codex, worker1:codex(worktree); reviewer:claude
```

Meaning:

- `cmd` is a shell pane, not an agent.
- `main`, `worker1`, and `reviewer` are agent names.
- `codex` and `claude` are providers.
- `;` splits left-to-right; `,` stacks top-to-bottom.
- `(worktree)` means that agent uses an isolated git worktree.

### Multi-window topology

When you want planning, implementation, review, and research in different tmux windows, use `version = 2` and `[windows]`:

```toml
version = 2
entry_window = "main"

[windows]
main = "main:codex"
work = "worker1:codex(worktree), worker2:claude(worktree)"
review = "reviewer:claude, qa:gemini"

[ui.sidebar]
mode = "every_window"
width = "15%"
bottom_height = 20
```

Note: `cmd` belongs to compact/hybrid single-window layouts. Do not put `cmd` inside `[windows]`.

### Per-agent model, API key, or base URL

Use compact format when layout is enough. If some agents need separate models or API routes, keep the compact header and add TOML overlays:

```toml
cmd; fast:codex, deep:codex; reviewer:claude

[agents.fast]
model = "gpt-5-mini"

[agents.deep]
key = "sk-..."
url = "https://api.example.com/v1"
model = "gpt-5"

[agents.reviewer]
model = "sonnet"
```

Do not commit real API keys to a public repository. `key` / `url` are agent-local shortcuts; advanced provider environment variables belong in provider profile or agent env fields.

</details>

## Use the ccb-config Skill

If you do not want to hand-write `.ccb/ccb.config`, ask an agent that supports skills to use `ccb-config`. Describe your project goal, parallelism, window grouping, worktree isolation, provider/model/API preferences, then let it discuss the shape with you and propose a complete config.

Example:

```text
$ccb-config Design a team for a Python library: main coordinates work, three workers implement in worktrees, and one reviewer checks regressions and risks. You can recommend whether this should stay single-window or become main/work/review windows.
```

<details>
<summary><b>ccb-config write flow and boundaries</b></summary>

1. Describe the project and team goal in natural language.
2. `ccb-config` reads the current config authority and decides whether this is a new config, an edit, or a migration.
3. It proposes one complete config before writing.
4. You confirm the proposal, then it edits only `.ccb/ccb.config`.
5. It validates the config and tells you to restart CCB for the change to take effect.

By default, `ccb-config` does not edit `.ccb/ccb_memory.md` or `.ccb/agents/<agent>/memory.md`. It should touch those memory files only when you explicitly ask for workflow memory or role memory design.

</details>

## Agent Collaboration

Normal `ask` is submit-and-return: after handing work to the target agent, the current agent should not poll and wait.

| Scenario | Recommended route |
| :--- | :--- |
| Human directly targets an agent | `/ask reviewer ...` or `$ask reviewer ...` |
| Current agent is inside an active CCB task and needs a child result before replying | `ask --callback reviewer` |
| Current agent sends independent work whose successful result does not need to return | `ask --silence worker1` |
| Queue or status diagnostics | `pend`, `watch`, `ping`, and similar commands are diagnostics only |

<details>
<summary><b>Why callback matters</b></summary>

If agent A is handling a user-originated CCB task and needs agent B's result to finish, A should use callback. CCB records the parent/child relationship, lets A's current turn end, and later delivers B's result back to A as a continuation. That avoids polling, queue blocking, and wasted context.

</details>

## Editor Workflow

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/nvim.png" alt="Neovim integration with multi-model code review" width="860">
</p>

CCB does not require leaving your editor. A common setup is: editor for code, CCB terminal for multi-agent planning, implementation, review, testing, and handoff.

## Install And Update

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `tmux`
- At least one agent CLI you plan to use, such as Codex, Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, or Droid
- Linux, macOS, or WSL

Current v7 / newer versions do not claim native Windows support. Native Windows support only applies to the v5 line. If you are on Windows and want current versions, use WSL and keep both `ccb` and agent CLIs inside WSL.

### Release first

For first install, prefer a package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge/releases). For existing installs:

```bash
ccb update
```

Source checkout install is for development, fix validation, or temporary fallback when a release package is not available.

### Uninstall

```bash
ccb uninstall
ccb reinstall

# Fallback from the package or source directory:
./install.sh uninstall
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>The expected agents did not appear</b></summary>

Run `ccb config validate` and check that `config_source_kind` is the layer you expected. Project config `.ccb/ccb.config` has highest priority; if it is missing, CCB uses `~/.ccb/ccb.config` or the built-in default.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Copy/paste is awkward</b></summary>

First try mouse-drag copy and `Ctrl+Shift+V` / `Cmd+V` paste. If tmux captures the drag, use function key `[` after `<prefix>` to enter copy / scroll mode. If you only want native terminal selection, many terminals support `Shift + mouse drag`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I want to migrate an old compact config to multi-window</b></summary>

Use `ccb-config` and describe your target window groups, such as main/work/review. Migration should preserve old agent names, providers, worktree markers, model/key/url fields, and write `[windows]` only after confirmation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The sidebar helper is unavailable</b></summary>

Prefer a release package because it carries or handles the sidebar helper. Source installs may need a local Rust toolchain if no compatible prebuilt helper is available.
